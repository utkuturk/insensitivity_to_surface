## Summary of the Empirical Pattern

This study asked whether surface-form overlap alone can trigger agreement attraction during comprehension. Turkish provided a strong test case because the plural morpheme *-lAr* appears on both nouns and verbs, but only nominal expressions can control agreement.

The two experiments converge on a clear dissociation. In Experiment 1, we observed robust attraction for nominal attractors, including a close match to the nominal benchmark dataset [@TurkLogacev2024], but no attraction for verbal attractors. Critically, this was not only a relative effect ("smaller than nominal"): follow-up analyses restricted to verbal conditions also showed no evidence for a verbal attraction effect. In Experiment 2, where nominal conditions were removed and only verbal conditions remained, the same null pattern replicated. Ungrammatical sentences with plural verbal attractors were not accepted more often than the corresponding singular-attractor controls.

Across experiments, the main conclusion is stable: verbal plural morphology that resembles nominal plural morphology in surface form does not behave like an agreement-relevant attractor. In what follows, we first consider why this null result is theoretically informative by examining the strength of the prediction it disconfirms, then discuss what it implies for models of agreement retrieval, address alternative theoretical accounts, and outline remaining limitations.

## Why the Null Result Is Theoretically Informative

The absence of verbal attraction is only interesting to the extent that the prediction of attraction was strong. We therefore begin by laying out why a phonological co-activation account should, in principle, have predicted attraction in the present design---and why its absence is thus surprising.

First, the verbal attractors in our materials are nominalized forms. Reduced relative clauses in Turkish are headed by a nominalized verb that takes case marking, is modified by adverbial and adjectival material, and occupies argument positions within the clause---syntactic properties that are diagnostic of noun phrases. Unlike a finite verb embedded in a complement clause, the attractor in our design is categorially [+N]. The verb vs. noun distinction that might trivially explain the null result in other languages does not straightforwardly apply here: both the nominal attractor and the verbal attractor occupy nominal positions and bear nominal syntax.

Second, the *-lAr* suffix on the reduced relative clause verb is string-ambiguous for number. Although syntactically this *-lAr* marks agreement with an implicit external argument rather than plurality of the nominalized head, the surface string does not disambiguate these two functions. A parser encountering a form like *gördükleri* ("the one(s) they saw") cannot determine from the string alone whether *-lAr* encodes nominal plural or verbal agreement---and indeed, the referent need not be inherently plural. This string ambiguity is precisely the kind of surface condition that a phonological co-activation account, as outlined by @Slioussar2018, should exploit: the form *-lAr* is the same morpheme, in the same string position, on a categorially nominal expression.

Third, the broader literature on phonological interference in memory supports the expectation that string overlap should produce confusion. Models of continuous speech processing [e.g., @McClellandElman1986; @Norris1994] have long established that phonological overlap triggers transient activation of competing representations [@Shillcock1990], and working memory research demonstrates that phonological similarity creates interference during retrieval [@Baddeley1966; @Conrad1964; @AchesonMacDonald2009]. If these mechanisms operated in the domain of agreement dependency resolution, Turkish verbal *-lAr* should have produced at least a measurable effect.

<!-- CHECK THIS: tricolon + two-clause closure is very AI. Rewrite with messier structure. -->
The fact that it does not---despite the attractor being nominal in category, bearing a string-ambiguous instantiation of *-lAr*, and surfacing in a context where phonological interference should be maximal---sets a strong upper bound on what surface overlap alone can contribute to agreement attraction. The null result is not simply a case of manipulating the wrong kind of overlap; it is a case where every condition favoring phonological co-activation is met, yet attraction is absent.

## How This Constrains Models of Agreement Retrieval

### The encoding problem

<!-- CHECK THIS: This subsection has the most uniform structure — each paragraph is "For X, the encoding is Y" in sequence. The nominal/verbal parallel is too neat. Consider varying paragraph lengths and merging some points. The "However, we note that" paragraph (line 33) starts with a classic AI hedge. -->

The dissociation between nominal and verbal attractors under shared surface morphology raises a direct question for models of agreement retrieval: what features are encoded for each attractor, and how do they interact with the retrieval cues generated by the verb? We consider this question within the cue-based retrieval framework [@LV05; @SmithVasishth], which provides the most explicit account of what information enters memory and how it is accessed during dependency resolution.

When the matrix verb is encountered and its agreement morphology must be verified, the parser initiates a retrieval operation. The retrieval cues target a chunk matching controller-relevant features---minimally something like [+SUBJ, +NOM, +PL] for a verb carrying plural agreement. Any chunk in memory that partially matches these cues can interfere with the retrieval, with the degree of interference determined by the number and weight of matching cues [@SmithVasishth; @EngelmannEtAl2019].

For a nominal attractor---for example, a genitive-marked plural noun---the encoded chunk would include features like [+N, +PL, +GEN]. This chunk partially matches the retrieval cues: it matches [+N] (it is a noun) and [+PL] (it is inherently plural), though it mismatches on [+NOM] and [+SUBJ]. The partial match generates interference, yielding the attraction effects observed in our nominal conditions and in prior Turkish studies [@LagoEtAl2019; @TurkLogacev2024]. Furthermore, genitive-marked nominals in Turkish can control agreement in possessive constructions, which may strengthen their association with controllerhood and increase the likelihood of retrieval [@LagoEtAl2019].

For the verbal attractor, the encoding is less straightforward. The nominalized verb carries *-lAr*, but this suffix marks agreement with an implicit external argument rather than inherent plurality of the nominalized clause. If the parser faithfully encodes this morphosyntactic distinction, the chunk would carry something like [+N, +AGR:3PL, +ACC/GEN] rather than [+N, +PL, +NOM]. Under this encoding, the chunk matches the retrieval cue [+N] but fails to match [+PL]---the agreement feature [+AGR:3PL] is relational (it records participation in agreement with something else, rather than expressing an inherent property of the chunk) and may not be treated as equivalent to intrinsic [+PL] by the retrieval mechanism.

<!-- CHECK THIS: "However, we note that" is a telltale AI hedge opener. Rewrite more directly. The "An alternative, and perhaps more parsimonious" phrasing is also very AI. -->
However, we note that this encoding-based explanation requires an assumption that the parser distinguishes between intrinsic number features and relational agreement features at the level of memory encoding. While this is theoretically plausible, it is not a standard assumption in current implementations of cue-based retrieval, which typically do not formalize this distinction [@LV05; @SmithVasishth]. An alternative, and perhaps more parsimonious, explanation is that the distinction is not about encoding per se but about the distributional statistics of the attractor form: the parser tracks whether the surface form of the attractor is one that is associated with being an agreement controller in other constructions. Genitive-marked nominals are; reduced relative clauses are not.

Our data cannot distinguish between these two explanations---feature-level encoding differences versus distributional controllerhood associations---and in practice, they may be two sides of the same coin: forms that are distributionally associated with controllerhood are precisely those that tend to carry intrinsic number features. What the data do rule out is any account in which surface-form overlap alone, regardless of encoding or distributional status, is sufficient to generate attraction.

### Predictions from other retrieval architectures

The implications of our findings extend beyond cue-based retrieval. Under the Marking and Morphing framework [@Eberhard1999; @BockEberhard1993], attraction arises because the attractor's number feature "marks" it as plural, and this marking can "morph" (spread to) the subject representation, leading to agreement errors. For morphing to occur, the attractor must carry a number feature that is capable of spreading. If the verbal *-lAr* encodes agreement with an external argument rather than inherent plurality, there is no independent number feature available to spread---the morphing pathway is blocked at the source. This account therefore independently predicts the null result, but for a different mechanistic reason than cue-based retrieval: no spreadable feature, rather than no matching controller cues.

Under noisy-channel or rational comprehension approaches [@FUTRELLETAL2020; @GibsonEtAl2013], comprehenders reweight the probability that the perceived input was generated by different possible sentences. For a nominal attractor, there exists a well-formed parse in which the plural noun serves as the subject---the parser can rationally reweight toward this alternative, increasing the likelihood of accepting an ungrammatical sentence. For a verbal attractor, however, there is no well-formed parse in which the reduced relative clause controls matrix verb agreement. There is simply no alternative sentence to reweight toward, and the model predicts that the ungrammatical sentence should be rejected at baseline rates. The absence of verbal attraction is therefore unsurprising under this framework as well.

The convergence of predictions across these three frameworks---cue-based retrieval, Marking and Morphing, and noisy-channel approaches---strengthens the theoretical claim. The result is not an idiosyncrasy of one particular model but a general consequence of the asymmetry between forms that can and cannot function as agreement controllers.

## Relation to Prior Cross-Linguistic Findings

The present pattern aligns with findings in English and Czech showing little to no attraction from pseudo-plural or merely form-overlapping elements [@BockEberhard1993;@HaskellMacDonald2003;@NicolEtAl:2016;@LacinaChromy2022]. It also fits work arguing that attraction is strongest when attractors carry features associated with possible controllers [@LagoEtAl2019;@BhatiaDillon2022;@BleotuDillon2024].

At first glance, these results seem to diverge from @Slioussar2018, where syncretic genitive singular forms in Russian---homophonous with nominative plural---yielded attraction-like patterns. We do not interpret this as a direct contradiction. A more coherent cross-study reading is that not all "overlap" is equivalent: overlap that is tied to controller-compatible representations can drive attraction, while overlap on elements that are never controllers does not. In our materials, verbal attractors in reduced clauses fall into the second category.

The Russian case is instructive precisely because it superficially parallels ours but diverges in controllerhood. Russian genitive nouns can serve as subjects in negative existential constructions, and within noun phrases, they can trigger number or gender marking on modifiers [@Babby2001; @ParteeBorschev2004]. This distributional association between genitive marking and controllerhood may be sufficient to license the genitive singular form as a competitor during retrieval. Czech, which lacks this genitive-subject construction, does not show attraction from the same syncretic forms [@LacinaChromy2022]. Turkish verbal *-lAr*, like Czech genitive, carries no controllerhood association: reduced relative clauses never serve as matrix-level agreement controllers, and the parser appears to track this distributional fact.

This interpretation also helps explain why nominal attraction remains robust while verbal attraction is absent under maximal surface similarity. The relevant contrast is not "phonology present vs. phonology absent," but "controller-compatible vs. controller-incompatible." The data from Hindi [@BhatiaDillon2022], Romanian [@BleotuDillon2024], and now Turkish converge on the generalization that the parser gates interference based on the abstract potential to be a controller, not on the surface form of the attractor.

## Context Effects on Overall Acceptability

An observation from Experiment 1 concerns the effect of the experimental context on overall acceptability. Between-experiment comparisons showed that overall acceptance rates for nominal-attractor sentences were lower in the present study than in @TurkLogacev2024. This pattern is consistent with prior work showing that the distribution of trials modulates acceptability judgments. While previous studies have demonstrated such shifts through explicit instructions or filler manipulation [@HammerlyEtAl2019; @ArehalliWittenberg2021], the present data suggest that the composition of experimental conditions themselves---here, the inclusion of verbal-attractor items that do not induce attraction---can lower baseline acceptance.

Importantly, however, this distributional shift did not substantially reduce the *magnitude* of attraction within the nominal-attractor conditions. That is, exposure to a substantial number of non-attracting trials shifted overall bias without recalibrating the attraction effect itself. This is somewhat unexpected given previous findings that the proportion of attraction-inducing items in an experiment can modulate the overall attraction pattern [@HammerlyEtAl2019; @Turk2022], and suggests that the high proportion of balanced fillers in the present design may have buffered participants' response criteria from adjusting to the experimental condition distribution.

This observation has methodological implications. In multi-condition attraction studies, the presence of conditions that do not induce attraction may shift the overall acceptance baseline, making it more conservative. Researchers interpreting between-study differences in base rates should consider whether the composition of experimental conditions---not just fillers or instructions---contributes to these shifts. At the same time, the stability of the attraction *magnitude* across studies suggests that the underlying mechanism driving attraction is relatively robust to distributional context, even when overall response criteria shift.

## Interpreting Null Effects as a Primary Result

The core theoretical claim in this paper is a null effect for verbal attraction, so evidential standards for null inference matter. We therefore treated this as a target estimand rather than a by-product of non-significance. Three points support the claim.

First, the pattern replicates across experiments with different condition structures. Experiment 1 included both nominal and verbal conditions, while Experiment 2 isolated verbal conditions. The verbal result was the same in both. This cross-design replication is important because it rules out the possibility that the null arises from a specific feature of one experimental context.

Second, the null pattern is coherent across descriptive and model-based analyses. In both experiments, the ungrammatical verbal conditions show very similar acceptance rates across attractor number, and the model-implied estimates for verbal attraction remain centered near zero. In Experiment 1, the RC-only follow-up model also failed to show evidence for a Grammaticality × Attractor Number interaction.

Third, the Experiment 1 follow-up analysis restricted to verbal trials directly addresses the most relevant question: whether verbal attraction is present at all, not only whether it is smaller than nominal attraction. That analysis also failed to find evidence for attraction.

Taken together, the data argue against verbal attraction of the size expected under form-driven accounts. This does not imply that the true effect is mathematically zero. It implies that any residual effect, if present, is not strong enough to support the theoretical prediction that surface overlap alone should generate attraction. The burden of evidence for a phonological co-activation account is now on demonstrating conditions under which verbal overlap *does* produce attraction---conditions that the present design was specifically constructed to provide and that failed to yield an effect.

## Alternative Explanations and Scope Conditions

### Methodological alternatives

One potential concern is that the mixed design in Experiment 1 could have altered response strategy. If exposure to strong nominal attraction changed participants' expectations or criteria, a weak verbal effect might have been masked. Experiment 2 addresses this directly by removing nominal items, and the same verbal null persists. This substantially weakens a strategy-only explanation.

Another concern is that acceptability judgments may miss transient processing interference that does not survive to final choice. This is possible in principle, and it motivates future time-course work with self-paced reading, eye-tracking, or EEG. However, the present data still constrain theory: any such transient effect would have to be weak enough not to produce reliable differences in final acceptability under the current designs, which were optimized for detecting attraction of the size observed in prior Turkish studies.

A further scope condition is highlighted by the unexpected grammatical asymmetry in Experiment 2 (lower acceptability in one grammatical verbal condition). This effect does not pattern like attraction and likely reflects a separate mechanism, possibly related to the referential properties of singular vs. plural reduced relative clauses. Importantly, it does not alter the critical ungrammatical comparison that defines attraction.

<!-- CHECK THIS: "This is unlikely for two reasons. First... Second..." is AI-formulaic. Merge into one flowing paragraph. The content is fine though. -->

### Could participants be ignoring verbal morphology?

A shallow-processing account might suggest that participants simply do not attend to morphological details on nominalized verbs in the speeded task, and that attraction is absent because the morphology is not processed at all. This is unlikely for two reasons. First, participants show robust sensitivity to verbal agreement in the baseline grammaticality contrast: ungrammatical sentences are reliably rejected, indicating that the matrix verb's agreement morphology is being processed. Second, in Experiment 2, participants showed an unexpected sensitivity to attractor number *within* grammatical conditions, demonstrating that morphological variation on the reduced relative clause is being registered. The null result for attraction is therefore not attributable to a general failure to process the attractor's morphology.

## Methodological Contributions

Beyond the theoretical result, the study design offers two methodological contributions.

First, the two-experiment structure isolates a key inferential risk. Experiment 1 demonstrates the nominal-verbal dissociation within a shared session, while Experiment 2 tests robustness of the verbal null in isolation. This combination allows stronger claims than either design alone. The logic mirrors the "mixed then pure" design strategy used in other domains of cognitive psychology: the mixed design provides the direct comparison, and the pure design rules out cross-condition contamination.

Second, the analysis plan emphasizes explicit null-effect inference (directional posterior probabilities, condition-specific estimands, and Bayes-factor workflows with prior-sensitivity planning). Given how often attraction claims hinge on nulls in specific cells---whether for a particular attractor type, a particular language, or a particular construction---this reporting strategy is useful beyond the present dataset. We encourage future studies of agreement attraction to treat null effects as target estimands and to report the associated evidential metrics.

## Limitations and Future Directions

Several limitations define the next steps.

The current dependent measure is speeded acceptability. While this measure is sensitive enough to detect canonical attraction effects and has been used productively in the Turkish agreement literature, it does not provide information about the time course of processing. Future work should pair acceptability judgments with time-sensitive methods (self-paced reading, eye-tracking, or EEG) to test whether verbal *-lAr* produces any transient interference that dissipates before the final judgment. If such transient effects were found, they would suggest that surface overlap does contribute to initial activation but is filtered before the decision stage---a theoretically interesting outcome that would further constrain models of retrieval.

The controller-potential account should be tested with graded manipulations rather than binary contrasts. The present study compares forms that are never controllers (reduced relative clauses) to forms that are sometimes controllers (genitive nouns). Future designs could compare attractors that differ in how strongly they are associated with controllerhood across constructions, while matching surface morphology. In Turkish, this might involve comparing different types of nominalized clauses that vary in whether they can license agreement in other constructions.

Cross-linguistic extension is essential. Turkish is an ideal test bed for the present contrast because *-lAr* surfaces identically on nouns and verbs, but the proposed mechanism---that the parser gates retrieval based on controller potential---should be evaluated in languages with different agreement architectures. Languages with richer case systems, different nominalization strategies, or different relationships between case, number, and controller licensing would provide converging evidence.

Finally, the distinction between intrinsic number features and relational agreement features deserves further investigation. Our data are consistent with the possibility that the parser does not encode verbal *-lAr* as [+PL] but rather as an agreement feature, and that this encoding difference---rather than (or in addition to) controllerhood statistics---is what blocks attraction. Investigating this would require materials in which *-lAr* on a nominalized verb is genuinely ambiguous between nominal plural and verbal agreement interpretations, with the ambiguity resolved by later context. If the parser initially activates [+PL] for such ambiguous forms but ultimately resolves the ambiguity, one might observe transient attraction that disappears as the parse is completed.

# Conclusion

The central finding is a dissociation under minimal surface contrast: nominal attractors produce attraction, verbal attractors with the same plural surface form do not. This null result is theoretically informative because the design maximized the conditions under which phonological co-activation should have produced an effect---the attractor is categorially nominal, the *-lAr* suffix is string-ambiguous for number, and phonological overlap in memory is well-established as a source of interference. The absence of attraction under these conditions indicates that surface-form overlap alone is insufficient to drive agreement illusions.

Several theoretical frameworks converge on this conclusion. Under cue-based retrieval, the verbal attractor either fails to match the critical retrieval cues (because agreement features are encoded differently from inherent number) or fails to carry the distributional association with controllerhood that enables a form to compete during retrieval. Under Marking and Morphing, there is no spreadable number feature. Under noisy-channel approaches, there is no well-formed alternative parse to reweight toward. In each case, the null result follows from the asymmetry between forms that can and cannot function as agreement controllers.

Agreement attraction in comprehension is therefore better characterized as grammar-constrained memory retrieval than as form-driven confusion. The human parser is sensitive to fine-grained distinctions in the morphosyntactic status of potential competitors---distinctions that are invisible on the surface of the string.

Summary of findings

Contextualizing of the findings

Theories of surface overlap 


We investigated whether surface-overlap advantage seen in reading times and comprehension questions can bleed into dependency resolution. Recent work by @Slioussar2018 argued that an accidental surface-overlap with a nominative plural form may result in activation of relevant cues even though the syntactic analysis of such a noun is clearly genitive singular. However, modulation of agremeent-relevant cues seems to be gated by being a possible controller in other relevant work in syncretism, and similar manipulations in English and Czech were unable to find a phonological modulation.

Using two speeded acceptability judgment experiments, we disentangled the statistical property of being a controller from a surface overlap. Turkish provides a useful test case because the plural *-lAr* appears both on verbs and on nouns, but only noun phrases can control agreement. If phonological overlap alone can activate controller-relevant cues, then plural-marked verbs in reduced relative clauses should induce attraction effects even though they never control agreement.

Across both experiments, we found that Turkish attraction is determined by being a potential controller rather than merely resembling one. Participants did not accepted ungrammatical sentences with containing plural verbal attractors more often than their singular counterparts. This absence of attraction persisted with or without a robust attraction with nominal attractors in the same session.

These results indicate that attraction depends on abstract feature overlap with potential controllers, not on surface-form similarity. This pattern converges with prior results in English and Czech that failed to find attraction for pseudoplural or phonologically plural forms [@BockEberhard1993;@HaskellMacDonald2003;@NicolEtAl:2016;@LacinaChromy2022], but appears to stand in contrast to findings from Russian [@Slioussar2018].

While the most obvious difference is syntactic---our non-attracting elements were verbs, whereas the attracting elements in Russian were nouns [@Slioussar2018]---this distinction alone is insufficient, as
prior work shows that even pseudoplural nouns in English and the same surface-overlap in Czech fail to attract [@BockEberhard1993;@LacinaChromy2022]. We propose instead that the parser 'gates' its search based on an element's abstract potential to be a controller. The Russian genitive noun, despite its surface form, is recognized as an element that can control agreement in other constructions, thus passing this abstract gate. Our Turkish verbal attractors or Czech genitive nouns, by contrast, lack this potential entirely; they can never be controllers. They therefore fail this gating, and no attraction is observed, despite the perfect phonological overlap.

This interpretation aligns with cross-linguistic findings showing that attraction is strongest when the attractor bears case or number morphology that can be associated with subjects or agreement controllers [@LagoEtAl2019;@BhatiaDillon2022;@BleotuDillon2024]. In other words, it is not form overlap per se, but feature ambiguity or a statistical association with controllerhood that matters. Earlier formulations of these models left open whether 'looking like' a controller or 'being able to be' a controller was critical. The present high-powered results from Turkish favor the latter: only morphologically licensed controllers, or those with a genuine abstract potential to be one, engage in attraction. -->
