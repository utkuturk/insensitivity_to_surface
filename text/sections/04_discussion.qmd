Contextualizing of the findings

Theories of surface overlap 


We investigated whether surface-overlap advantage seen in reading times and comprehension questions can bleed into dependency resolution. Recent work by @Slioussar2018 argued that an accidental surface-overlap with a nominative plural form may result in activation of relevant cues even though the syntactic analysis of such a noun is clearly genitive singular. However, modulation of agremeent-relevant cues seems to be gated by being a possible controller in other relevant work in syncretism, and similar manipulations in English and Czech were unable to find a phonological modulation.

Using two speeded acceptability judgment experiments, we disentangled the statistical property of being a controller from a surface overlap. Turkish provides a useful test case because the plural *-lAr* appears both on verbs and on nouns, but only noun phrases can control agreement. If phonological overlap alone can activate controller-relevant cues, then plural-marked verbs in reduced relative clauses should induce attraction effects even though they never control agreement.

Across both experiments, we found that Turkish attraction is determined by being a potential controller rather than merely resembling one. Participants did not accepted ungrammatical sentences with containing plural verbal attractors more often than their singular counterparts. This absence of attraction persisted with or without a robust attraction with nominal attractors in the same session.

These results indicate that attraction depends on abstract feature overlap with potential controllers, not on surface-form similarity. This pattern converges with prior results in English and Czech that failed to find attraction for pseudoplural or phonologically plural forms [@BockEberhard1993;@HaskellMacDonald2003;@NicolEtAl:2016;@LacinaChromy2022], but appears to stand in contrast to findings from Russian [@Slioussar2018].

While the most obvious difference is syntactic---our non-attracting elements were verbs, whereas the attracting elements in Russian were nouns [@Slioussar2018]---this distinction alone is insufficient, as
prior work shows that even pseudoplural nouns in English and the same surface-overlap in Czech fail to attract [@BockEberhard1993;@LacinaChromy2022]. We propose instead that the parser 'gates' its search based on an element's abstract potential to be a controller. The Russian genitive noun, despite its surface form, is recognized as an element that can control agreement in other constructions, thus passing this abstract gate. Our Turkish verbal attractors or Czech genitive nouns, by contrast, lack this potential entirely; they can never be controllers. They therefore fail this gating, and no attraction is observed, despite the perfect phonological overlap.

This interpretation aligns with cross-linguistic findings showing that attraction is strongest when the attractor bears case or number morphology that can be associated with subjects or agreement controllers [@LagoEtAl2019;@BhatiaDillon2022;@BleotuDillon2024]. In other words, it is not form overlap per se, but feature ambiguity or a statistical association with controllerhood that matters. Earlier formulations of these models left open whether 'looking like' a controller or 'being able to be' a controller was critical. The present high-powered results from Turkish favor the latter: only morphologically licensed controllers, or those with a genuine abstract potential to be one, engage in attraction.
