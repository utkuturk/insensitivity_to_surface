# Introduction 
- Background: Agreement attraction refers to cases where verbs incorrectly agree with a nearby noun rather than the true subject, producing “grammaticality illusions” in both production and comprehension tasks.
- Cross-linguistic picture: Attraction magnitudes vary widely across tasks and exposure contexts, sometimes depending on participants’ expectations or response biases within an experiment (e.g., Hammerly et al., 2019; Laurinavichyute & von der Malsburg, 2023).
- Turkish as a test case: Turkish number agreement offers a unique window into this issue because the plural morpheme –lAr is homophonous across nouns and verbs. This overlap allows us to test whether attraction effects stem from surface-form similarity or abstract morphosyntactic features.
- Current motivation: In many experiments, the distribution of conditions may itself shape how participants respond—when certain types of ungrammatical sentences are more frequent, people may adjust their acceptance patterns. Such within-experiment statistical sensitivity could inflate or suppress apparent attraction effects.
- Goals of this study:
	1.	Form-driven test: Determine whether the presence of a plural morpheme on a verbal attractor (sharing surface form with nominal plurals) triggers attraction.
	2.	Statistical-sensitivity test: Examine whether attraction magnitude changes when different attractor types (nominal vs. verbal) co-occur in the same experiment.
- Overview: Two speeded acceptability-judgment experiments address these questions using Bayesian hierarchical modeling of response patterns.

# Experiment 1: Testing Form-Driven Processing 
- Goal: determine if surface plural forms (verbal -lAr) elicit illusionary agreement.
- Participants: 80 Turkish speakers (Boğaziçi undergraduates).
- Design: 2 × 2 (Grammaticality × Attractor Number).
- Materials: relative-clause verbs as attractors; same surface morphology as nominal plurals.
- Procedure: speeded acceptability judgments, 1500 ms deadline.
- Analysis: Bayesian probit GLM (brms); random intercepts/slopes by subject/item.
- Results:
  - High filler accuracy (> .9).
  - No difference in ungrammatical sentences between plural vs singular attractors.
  - Posterior coefficients near 0; 95 % CIs within ROPE.
- Discussion:
  - No evidence for form-driven guessing.
  - Participants rely on abstract number features, not phonological similarity.

# Experiment 2: Testing Within-Experiment Statistical Sensitivity 
- Goal: test whether attraction changes when both attractor types occur in one experiment.
- Participants: 95 Turkish speakers.
- Design: 2 × 2 × 2 (Grammaticality × Attractor Number × Attractor Type [nominal vs verbal]).
- Procedure & analysis: same as Experiment 1.
- Results:
  - Attraction replicated for nominal attractors (Δ ≈ 0.07).
  - Verbal attractors again showed null effect.
  - Global decline in yes-responses relative to earlier studies → participants became more conservative.
- Discussion:
  - Exposure to verbal conditions reduced attraction magnitude overall.
  - Indicates participants adapt to statistical properties of the task.
  - Aligns with learning-based cue-weighting accounts (Haskell et al. 2010).

# General Discussion 
- Synthesis:
  - No evidence for surface-form matching; effects are feature-based.
  - Attraction magnitude changes with condition distribution → adaptive tuning.
- Interpretation:
  - Supports an adaptive parser sensitive to within-experiment statistics.
  - Challenges “shallow” or “good-enough” accounts that attribute attraction to phonological overlap.
- Broader implication:
  - Agreement processing is flexible and probabilistic; illusions arise from learned cue validity.
- Limitations:
  - Syntactic depth asymmetry (verbal attractors more embedded).
  - Need future designs equating structure (e.g., embedded-object attractors).
- Conclusion:
  - Turkish attraction effects arise from abstract feature retrieval not surface level shallow form-matching.  
  - The evaluation of abstract features are modulated by distributional learning within the experiment.
