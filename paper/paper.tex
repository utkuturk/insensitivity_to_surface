\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Sentence processing is shaped not only by grammatical constraints but
also by plausibility, frequency, and task-specific factors. Recent work
shows that such influences can substantially modulate reading and
judgment behavior (r
\citep{LauraMalsbug24, ArehalliWittenberg2021, HammerlyEtAl2019, LogacevVasishth2016}).
One domain where these effects are especially informative is
\emph{agreement attraction}, cases in which a verb erroneously agrees
with a nearby noun rather than its grammatical subject, producing
so-called grammaticality illusions (Bock \& Miller, 1991; Pearlmutter,
Garnsey, \& Bock, 1999).

\begin{exe}
\ex[*]{\label{og}The key to the cabinets are rusty.}
\end{exe}

Agreement errors in sentences like (\ref{og}) have been treated either
as a failure of feature reconcilation or a failure of memory encoding.
The former set of accounts explain these errors as a by-product of how
number feature of a phrase is calculated in real-time
\citep{BockMiller:1991, EberhardEtAl2005, HammerlyEtAl2019}. For
example, \citet{EberhardEtAl2005} argue that depending on conceptual
number, morphophonological number marking, or syntactic dependencies
within a phrase, speakers assign a probabilistic number value to
phrases. The errors arise when additional plurality features from
different sources end up contributing to the final number representation
of a phrase. On the other hand, the latter set of accounts claim that
the initial representation is not erroneous, but speakers are sometimes
unable to correctly retrieve the controller
\citep{WagersEtAl:2009, Dillon2013a}. For example,
\citet{WagersEtAl:2009} argue that the parser normally check the
agreement relation by retrieving the relevant chunk in memory using the
retrieval cues provided by the agreement probe. In sentences like (1),
speakers occasionally retrieve the incorrect element due to the fact
that neither nouns fully match the relevant cues.

Recent studies have asked whether the form of the attractor, its
morphophonology or phonology, plays a role in attraction, above and
beyond its abstract features. Several experiments have manipulated
morphological case similarity between subjects and attractors, reasoning
that syncretism or surface ambiguity could enhance competition during
retrieval. For instance, German determiner--noun phrases that are
ambiguous between nominative and accusative produce more agreement
errors than unambiguous ones \citep{HartsuikerEtAl2003}. In Russian,
case syncretism between nominative plural and genitive singular forms
(e.g., kraski/kraska) increases attraction errors and speeds
ungrammatical verbs \citep{Slioussar2018}. However, these findings are
not clear.

A separate line of work has tested purely phonological or orthographic
overlap, showing that words that sound or look like plural forms can
bias processing, though the evidence is mixed. Some studies report
increased interference when attractors share plural-like endings or
sound shapes \citep{HaskellMacDonald2003, BrehmEtAl2020}, while others
find no such effect when frequency and morphology are controlled
\citep{BockEberhard1993}. Overall, results remain inconsistent: surface
overlap sometimes amplifies attraction but cannot reliably produce it
without matching syntactic features.

In this paper, we test an unexplored question using Turkish, a language
where verbal and nominal plural marking share the same surface form, the
suffix --lAr. Unlike in languages where attraction and case syncretism
involve ambiguity between morphosyntactic categories (e.g., nominative
vs.~accusative), Turkish allows us to isolate pure form overlap: both
verbs and nouns carry --lAr, but only nominal plural introduces a number
feature that can serve as an agreement controller. Verbal --lAr realizes
agreement morphology, not an attracting feature. Thus, Turkish provides
a rare opportunity to ask whether form-based overlap alone---in the
absence of matching syntactic features---can produce attraction effects.

We use reduced relative clause (RRC) structures, in which the verb
itself can appear as the attractor. This allows us to manipulate verbal
vs.~nominal plural morphology while holding other syntactic factors
constant. Importantly, Turkish --lAr syncretism here is not
feature-ambiguous (as in case syncretism); it is a form-only overlap
that does not share case or argument status with the subject, but only
number morphology. The key question is whether such form-based overlap
is sufficient to trigger attraction-like acceptability increases for
ungrammatical sentences.

To test this, we conducted two high powered speeded acceptability
judgment experiments. Experiment 1 tested the form hypothesis directly
by comparing ungrammatical sentences with verbal-plural
vs.~verbal-singular attractors. Experiment 2 replicated this design but
included additional nominal-attractor items from a previous Turkish
attraction study \citep{TurkLogacev2024}, allowing us to test whether
the distribution of item types---and the presence of genuine
attraction-inducing elements---modulates the outcome.

Across both experiments, we found no evidence that verbal --lAr induces
attraction, even when canonical nominal attractors are present in the
same session. This pattern aligns with prior findings that Turkish
attraction is insensitive to morphological syncretism
\citep{TurkLogacev2024} and suggests that surface-form overlap alone
does not drive agreement illusions. Rather, Turkish attraction appears
to depend on abstract feature overlap between potential controllers and
agreement probes.

\subsection{Form-related strategies}\label{form-related-strategies}

Form-based overlap between elements in a sentence can influence how
agreement dependencies are processed. A substantial body of work has
shown that the parser and the production system are sensitive not only
to syntactic or semantic relations but also to the surface form of
words. Phonological and morphological similarities can bias memory
retrieval or lead to partial feature activation. These effects have been
taken to suggest that, under certain circumstances, speakers and
comprehenders rely on shallow or heuristic cues to complete
dependencies.

One line of research has examined whether purely phonological similarity
between singular and plural forms can induce agreement attraction. Bock
and Eberhard (1993) tested whether attractors that only sound plural,
pseudoplurals such as \emph{course}, increase agreement errors compared
to true plural nouns. They reasoned that if participants rely on
phonological cues rather than abstract features, words ending with
plural-like sounds (/s/ or /z/) should behave like true plurals.
Participants completed sentence preambles such as
(\ref{ex:bockeberhard93}), where the head noun (\emph{player}) was
singular but the attractor varied in form.

\ea \label{ex:bockeberhard93}
    \ea {Pseudoplural Attractor} \\ The {player} on the {course} \ldots{}
    \ex {Singular Attractor} \\ The {player} on the {court} \ldots{}
    \ex {Plural Attractor} \\ The {player} on the {courts} \ldots{}
    \z
\z

They found that pseudoplural attractors did not increase plural
agreement rates. Later studies, however, provided evidence that overt
morphological marking can enhance interference. Haskell and MacDonald
(2003) reported that attractors with regular plural morphology were more
likely to elicit plural verbs than irregular plurals, particularly when
the head was collective. Brehm, Hussey, and Christianson (2020) extended
this to comprehension: attractors with plural-like endings facilitated
processing in ungrammatical sentences, yielding faster reading times at
the verb region. Related work in short-term memory and word recognition
shows similar effects---items that overlap phonologically or
morphologically are more confusable and more easily retrieved (Copeland
\& Radvansky, 2001; Rastle \& Davis, 2008). Together, these findings
indicate that phonological and morphological overlap can modulate
interference during agreement computation by increasing the
accessibility of plural-like representations, even when structural cues
remain intact.

A different set of findings comes from research on case syncretism,
which has been shown to affect how comprehenders interpret grammatical
relations. In languages such as Japanese and Russian, sentences are
processed more easily when case marking clearly distinguishes syntactic
roles, whereas ambiguity arising from syncretic or overlapping markers
slows comprehension and reduces accuracy (Yamashita, 1997; Kim, 1999;
Logačev \& Vasishth, 2012; Babyonyshev \& Gibson, 1999). Fedorenko,
Babyonyshev, and Gibson (2004), for example, found that Russian readers
showed longer reading times when two noun phrases shared the same case
ending, suggesting that overlapping case forms make it harder to
maintain distinct syntactic representations.

The same pattern extends to agreement attraction, where syncretism can
increase competition between a true controller and a distractor. In
German, Hartsuiker et al.~(2003) used the overlap between accusative and
nominative determiners and compared these ambiguous forms to
distinctively marked dative forms. Participants produced more agreement
errors when the preambles contained two noun phrases whose determiners
were not distinctively marked, as in (\ref{ger-amb}), compared to cases
where the attractor could be distinguished by form alone, as in
(\ref{ger-dist}). Crucially, this effect was limited to feminine nouns,
the only gender showing nominative--accusative syncretism in plural
forms.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ger}
\begin{xlist}
\ex \label{ger-amb}
\gll Die Stellungnahme gegen die Demonstration-en\\
the.F.NOM.SG position against the.F.ACC.PL demonstration-PL\\
\glt `The position against the demonstrations'
\ex \label{ger-dist}
\gll Die Stellungnahme zu den Demonstration-en\\
the.F.NOM.SG position on the.F.DAT.PL demonstration-PL\\
\glt `The position on the demonstrations'
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

When the determiner \emph{die} can mark both nominative and accusative,
the attractor becomes more easily confused with the subject, resulting
in attraction. When the dative determiner \emph{den} unambiguously marks
case, the likelihood of an error decreases. This finding shows that
morphological ambiguity at the level of form can increase interference
even without structural ambiguity.

Even stronger evidence that surface-form similarity can override
abstract features comes from Russian. Slioussar (2018) examined
sentences in which the attractor was genitive singular---a form
homophonous with the nominative plural---and compared them to
unambiguous genitive plurals. Across production, judgment, and reading
studies, participants made more agreement errors and read ungrammatical
verbs faster when the attractor was genitive singular, that is,
grammatically singular but formally plural-like.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{rus}
\begin{xlist}
\ex \label{rus-gen-sg}
\gll Korobka dlya kraski byla/*byli \ldots \\
box.F.SG.NOM for paint.GEN.SG$_{=NOM.PL}$ be.PST.F.SG/*be.PST.F.PL \\
\glt `A box for the paint(s) was/*were \dots'
\ex \label{rus-gen-pl}
\gll Korobka dlya krasok byla/*byli \ldots \\
box.F.SG.NOM for paint.GEN.PL$_{\neq NOM.PL}$ be.PST.F.SG/*be.PST.F.PL \\
\glt `A box for the paint(s) was/*were \dots'
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

The attractor in (\ref{rus-gen-sg}) is syntactically singular, yet it
increases the likelihood of plural agreement. The effect therefore
cannot be attributed to genuine feature overlap. Slioussar argued that
participants sometimes rely on surface-level cues that are easier to
access than abstract morphosyntactic features, producing attraction
patterns driven by form rather than by structure.

Across languages, phonological and morphological overlap can strengthen
interference between nouns and verbs, though these effects are highly
dependent on language-specific morphology and structural context.
Turkish provides a particularly clear test case: its plural morpheme
\emph{-lAr} occurs both on nouns and verbs, creating surface-form
overlap without shared number features. The Turkish experiments below
use this property to test whether form-based overlap alone can elicit
attraction.

\subsection{Attraction Accounts}\label{attraction-accounts}

Two main accounts have been proposed to explain agreement attraction
effects: the Marking and Morphing model and the cue-based retrieval
model. Both frameworks aim to capture why a plural attractor can
interfere with the computation of agreement, but they differ in where
the interference arises and in how they represent linguistic features.

Under Marking and Morphing (Bock and Eberhard, 1993; Eberhard et al.,
2005), attraction results from spreading activation among number
features during agreement encoding. The plural feature of a nearby noun
can transiently activate the plural feature on the subject node, making
a singular subject temporarily appear plural. The strength of this
spreading activation decreases with syntactic distance, predicting
stronger interference from local attractors. Because this account ties
attraction to the activation of morphological features, it could in
principle accommodate effects of surface-form similarity. Morphological
or phonological overlap between elements might increase activation
strength or delay decay, thereby amplifying interference. However, the
model does not include a mechanism for distinguishing between
morphophonological and abstract feature overlap, and it provides no role
for case information or other morphosyntactic cues beyond number. It
also has difficulty explaining attraction from attractors that lie
outside the subject phrase.

In contrast, cue-based retrieval accounts (e.g., Wagers et al., 2009;
Dillon et al., 2013) locate attraction at the stage of memory retrieval,
when the parser or production system attempts to recover the controller
of agreement. Retrieval is guided by a set of cues such as number, case,
and syntactic position. Interference arises when a non-controller
partially matches these cues and is incorrectly retrieved. In this
framework, surface-form overlap affects processing only if it
contributes to cue overlap. For example, plural morphology or
phonological endings could influence retrieval if the system treats them
as diagnostic of plural number. Because the model allows cues to be
weighted differently depending on their reliability, it naturally
accounts for cross-linguistic variability in the role of case marking
and other morphosyntactic features.

The two frameworks therefore make different predictions for the
influence of surface similarity. Marking and Morphing could predict
form-based attraction if overlapping phonological or morphological
representations share activation nodes, whereas cue-based retrieval
predicts form effects only when they are encoded as retrieval cues.
Empirical results from languages with rich morphology support the latter
view. Studies in English have shown limited effects of pseudoplurals and
orthographic similarity, and cross-linguistic work in languages such as
German, Russian, and Turkish indicates that agreement attraction depends
on morphosyntactic feature overlap rather than on phonological form. In
particular, Turkish provides a critical test case: the nominal and
verbal plural morphemes are identical in form but differ in feature
content, yet only nominal plural markers trigger attraction. This
pattern is consistent with a feature-based account and suggests that
surface-form similarity alone does not drive agreement attraction.

\subsection{Turkish morpho-syntactic
background}\label{turkish-morpho-syntactic-background}

Turkish provides a unique testing ground for distinguishing form-based
and feature-based agreement processes because the same plural morpheme
\emph{-lAr} is used on both nouns and verbs. The morpheme marks
plurality on nouns and third-person plural agreement on verbs, as shown
in (\ref{ex:lar}). Plural marking on the verb is optional when the
plural subject is overt but obligatory when the subject is dropped.
Singular subjects cannot co-occur with plural verbs.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:lar}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll Çocuk-lar okul-a git-ti-ler.\\
child-\Pl{} school-\Dat{} go-\Pst{}-\Pl{}\\
\glt `The children went to school.'
\ex[*]{
\gll Çocuk okul-a git-ti-ler.\\
child school-\Dat{} go-\Pst{}-\Pl{}\\
\glt Intended: `The child went to school.'}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

This surface identity between nominal and verbal \emph{-lAr} allows a
direct test of whether agreement attraction effects in Turkish depend on
the \emph{form} of the morpheme or its \emph{syntactic feature}.

Turkish also allows \emph{reduced relative clauses} (RRCs), where the
relative clause consists only of a nominalized verb. The nominalizer
\emph{-dIK} bears agreement features and can co-occur with plural
\emph{-lAr}. In (\ref{ex:redrc}), the RRC verb functions as the modifier
of the head noun, and the same \emph{-lAr} morpheme appears on the
embedded verb.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:redrc}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll [Tut-tuğ-u aşçı] mutfak-ta çalış-ıyor.\\
hire-\Nmlz{}-\Poss{} cook kitchen-\Loc{} work-\Prog{}\\
\glt `The cook that (he) hired is working in the kitchen.'
\ex
\gll [Tut-tuk-lar-ı aşçı] mutfak-ta çalış-ıyor.\\
hire-\Nmlz{}-\Pl{}-\Poss{} cook kitchen-\Loc{} work-\Prog{}\\
\glt `The cook that they hired is working in the kitchen.'
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Because RRCs are nominalized, they can also serve as
\emph{potential subjects} in a clause. The nominalized verb phrase heads
a DP and can occupy subject position without an overt head noun, as in
(\ref{ex:rrcsubject}).

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:rrcsubject}
\gll [Gel-diğ-i] belli-değil.\\
come-\Nmlz{}-\Poss{} clear-\Neg{}\\
\glt `It is not clear that (he) came.'\\
\gll [Git-tik-ler-i] duy-ul-du.\\
go-\Nmlz{}-\Pl{}-\Poss{} hear-\Pass{}-\Pst{}\\
\glt `It was heard that they went.'
\end{exe}

These morphological and syntactic properties make Turkish suitable for
contrasting nominal and verbal \emph{-lAr}. In Experiments 1 and 2, the
\emph{-lAr} morpheme on reduced relative clause verbs served as a verbal
attractor, while \emph{-lAr} on nouns provided nominal attractors. This
design tests whether agreement attraction in Turkish is driven by
surface-form similarity or by abstract agreement features.

\subsubsection{Previous findings in Turkish
attraction.}\label{previous-findings-in-turkish-attraction.}

Previous research in Turkish has shown that participants do similar
errors in agreement attraction comprehension
\citep{LagoEtAl2019, TurkLogacev2024, Ulusoy2023}. \citet{LagoEtAl2019}
demonstrated agreement attraction effects using genitive-possessive
contructions in a speeded acceptability judgment. Their sentences
included a complex subjects `milyonerlerin terzisi' (millionaires'
tailor) similar to English saxon-genitives as in (\ref{lago}).

\begin{exe}
\ex[*]{\label{lago}
\gll Milyoner-ler-in öğretmen-i mutfak-ta sürekli zıpla-dı-lar.\\
millionaire-PL-GEN fix-POSS kitchen-LOC non.stop jump-PST-PL\\
\glt `Millionaires' fix jumped$_{pl}$ in the kitchen non-stop.'}
\end{exe}

\citet{TurkLogacev2024} showed that this effect survives even when the
confounding form-ambiguity on the heads `öğretmen-i' is resolved. The -i
marking in Turkish is ambiguous between possessive and accusative case,
and the accusative case cannot control agreement in Turkish. They
conclude that Turkish speakers do not utilize the form-related features
in processing. However, \citet{Ulusoy2023} (Experiment 3) found that
attraction effects disappeared when the case marking on the attractor,
not the head as in \citet{TurkLogacev2024}, is manipulated. In a series
of experiments, they showed a nominative marked plural constituent
(\ref{ulusoy-nom}) can increase acceptability of ungrammatical sentences
and decrease the reading difficulty compared to its singular
constituent, however a similar effect does not arise with dative marked
constituents (\ref{ulusoy-dat}).

\begin{exe}
\ex  \label{ulusoy}
\begin{xlist}
\ex[*]{\label{ulusoy-nom}
\gll Kütüphaneci(-ler) çalışkan öğrenci-nin iste-dik-ler-i kitab-ı şimdi bul-du-lar.\\

\ex[*]{\label{ulusoy-dat}

\glt `The instructor caught the child who the girl carelessly pushed.'}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Given that

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  However, no work has directly tested whether verbal plural morphology
  can induce similar illusions, or how mixing different attractor types
  within an experiment affects the magnitude of attraction.
\end{itemize}

Turkish provides an especially informative case because both nominal and
verbal plural markers are realized with the same morpheme, --lAr, yet
only nominal plurals bear the syntactic features required for agreement.
This allows us to ask whether participants rely on surface-form
similarity or on abstract feature representations when evaluating
agreement.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Morphological properties
\item
  Turkish marks number on both nouns and verbs using the identical
  plural morpheme --lAr.
\item
  Only nominal plurals introduce number features that can agree with the
  verb; verbal --lAr expresses verbal agreement but is not a potential
  controller.
\item
  Because of this homophony, Turkish allows form-overlap and
  feature-mismatch to be disentangled experimentally.
\end{itemize}

In our first experiment, we test whether plural marking on a verbal
distractor---which is morphologically identical but syntactically
irrelevant---can elicit attraction. In the second experiment, we combine
these verbal distractor conditions with standard nominal attractor
conditions to assess how their co-occurrence affects participants'
judgments. If attraction effects reflect flexible, context-sensitive
processing, the inclusion of verbal distractors should dilute or
eliminate the illusion typically observed with nominal attractors.

Together, these experiments extend previous findings on agreement
attraction and task sensitivity in two key ways. First, they show that
surface-level overlap---even when morphologically identical---does not
by itself produce agreement attraction, indicating that participants
rely on abstract morphosyntactic features rather than phonological
forms. Second, they reveal that participants are not only influenced by
the global structure of an experiment (such as the proportion of fillers
or grammatical items) but also by the presence of other condition types
within the same task. In other words, attraction effects are attenuated
when competing, non-attracting conditions are included, suggesting that
agreement processing is dynamically tuned to the statistical context of
the experiment itself.

\subsection{Experimental logic and
predictions}\label{experimental-logic-and-predictions}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Goal 1: test whether purely form-based overlap (verbal --lAr) elicits
  attraction.
\item
  Prediction: if attraction is driven by form, verbal plural distractors
  should yield higher ``acceptable'' rates for ungrammatical plurals.
\item
  Alternative: if attraction depends on abstract features, no effect of
  verbal --lAr should appear.
\item
  Goal 2: test whether the co-occurrence of different attractor types
  modulates attraction.
\item
  Prediction: if participants adapt to the distribution of conditions,
  adding verbal distractors (which share the plural form but lack
  agreement features) should attenuate or eliminate the
  nominal-attractor illusion.
\item
  Summary: These experiments jointly test whether agreement attraction
  in Turkish reflects shallow form matching or feature-based computation
  that is sensitive to the statistical context of the task.

\section{Experiment 1: Testing Form-Driven
Processing}\label{experiment-1-testing-form-driven-processing}

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}

We recruited 80 undergraduate students to participate in the experiment
in exchange for course credit. All participants were native Turkish
speakers, with an average age of 21 (range: 18 -- 31). The experiment
was carried out following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki
and the regulations concerning research ethics at Bogazici University.
All participants provided informed consent before their participation
and their identities were completely anonymised.

\subsection{Materials}\label{materials}

We used 40 sets of sentences like (\ref{exp}), in which we manipulated
(i) the number of the attractor and (ii) the number agreement on the
verb. Both plural markings were marked with the suffix -ler/-lar, while
the singular number and singular agreement were marked by its absence.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{exp}
\begin{xlist}
\ex[]{\label{ss}
\gll Tut-tuğ-u aşçı mutfak-ta sürekli zıpla-dı.\\
hire-NMLZ-POSS cook[NOM] kitchen-LOC non.stop jump-PST\\
\glt `The cook they hired$_{sg}$ jumped$_{sg}$ in the kitchen non-stop.'}
\ex[*]{\label{sp}
\gll Tut-tuğ-u aşçı mutfak-ta sürekli zıpla-dı-lar.\\
hire-NMLZ-POSS cook[NOM] kitchen-LOC non.stop jump-PST-PL\\
\glt `The cook they hired$_{sg}$ jumped$_{pl}$ in the kitchen non-stop.'}
\ex[]{\label{ps}
\gll Tut-tuk-lar-ı aşçı mutfak-ta sürekli zıpla-dı.\\
hire-NMLZ-PL-POSS cook[NOM] kitchen-LOC non.stop jump-PST\\
\glt `The cook they hired$_{pl}$ jumped$_{sg}$ in the kitchen non-stop.'}
\ex[*]{\label{pp}
\gll Tut-tuk-lar-ı aşçı mutfak-ta sürekli zıpla-dı-lar.\\
hire-NMLZ-PL-POSS cook[NOM] kitchen-LOC non.stop jump-PST-PL\\
\glt `The cook they hired$_{pl}$ jumped$_{pl}$ in the kitchen non-stop.'}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

All sentences were adapted by previous studies in Turkish agreement
attraction \citep{LagoEtAl2019, TurkLogacev2024}. Sentences started with
a complex subject NP like `tuttukları aşçı' `the cook they hired,' in
which the nominalized relative clause functioned as the attractor, and
the head noun were bare. Because the plural marking on nominals is not
optional and the head noun was singular, absent of -lar, in all
conditions, sentences with plural verb agreement were ungrammatical. To
inhibit participants from forming a task-related strategy in which they
deemed the sentence ungrammatical upon seeing a plural verb, half of our
fillers included plural grammatical verbs, while the other half included
singular ungrammatical verbs.

\subsection{Procedures}\label{procedures}

The experiment was run online, using the web-based platform Ibex Farm
\citep{Drummond2013}. Each experimental session took approximately 25
minutes to complete. Participants provided demographic information and
gave informed consent to participate in the experiment. They then
proceeded to read the instructions and were given nine practice trials
before the experiment began.

Each trial began with a blank screen for 600 ms, followed by a
word-by-word RSVP presentation of the sentence in the center of the
screen, followed by a prompt to indicate their acceptability judgment.
Sentences were presented word-by-word in the center of the screen in 30
pt font size, at a rate of 400 ms per word. Participants saw a blank
screen for 100 ms between each word, and to see the next item, they
needed to press the space key. Participants were asked to press the key
P to indicate that a sentence is acceptable and Q to indicate that the
sentence is unacceptable. They were instructed to provide judgments as
quickly as possible. During the practice, but not during the experiment,
a warning message in red font appeared if they did not respond within
5,000 ms.

Participants saw 40 experimental and 40 filler sentences. Experimental
sentences were distributed among four different lists according to a
Latin-square design. Every participant saw one version of the experiment
with a specific list and one item per condition.

\subsection{Analysis and Results}\label{analysis-and-results}

Participants showed high accuracy in both grammatical (M = 0.94, CI =
{[}0.92,0.95{]}) and ungrammatical filler sentences (M = 0.92, CI =
{[}0.9,0.93{]}), indicating that they understood the task and performed
it reliably.

Figure 1 presents the overall means and credible intervals for `yes'
responses across experimental conditions. As shown, ungrammatical
sentences with plural attractors were rated as acceptable as their
counterparts with singular attractors (M = 0.06 and 0.05, CI = {[}0.04,
0.07{]} and {[}0.03, 0.07{]} for singular and plural attractors,
respectively).

On the other hand, accuracy in grammatical conditions was modulated by
the number of the attractor in an unexpected way. Participants rated
grammatical sentences with singular attractors as grammatical less often
(M = 0.92, CI = {[}0.9,0.94{]}) compared to their counterpars with
plural attractors (M = 0.95, CI = {[}0.93,0.96{]}).

}

\caption{Mean proportion of `acceptable' responses by grammaticality and
attractor number. Error bars show 95\% Clopper--Pearson confidence
intervals.}

\end{figure}%

These descriptive trends were confirmed by our Bayesian mixed-effects
models implemented in brms, assuming a Bernoulli logit link. The model
was fitted to the binary \emph{yes/no} responses and included fixed
effects for Grammaticality and Attractor Number and their interaction,
and random intercepts and slopes for both subjects and items.

Posterior estimates are summarized in Figure 2. The model revealed a
positive effect of grammaticality (\(\beta\) = 5.92 {[}5.41, 6.46{]},
P(\(\beta\) \textgreater{} 1.00)), but no reliable main effect of
attractor number (\(\beta\) = 0.15 {[}-0.19, 0.51{]}, P(\(\beta\)
\textgreater{} 0.81)). On the other hand, there was a small but positive
interaction (\(\beta\) = 0.66 {[}-0.02, 1.38{]}, P(\(\beta\)
\textgreater{} 0.97)). To clarify the effects' presence in grammaticals
only, we fitted two more models that is fitted to the subset of the
data. While the model fitted to grammatical conditions only showed an
effect of attractor number (\(\beta\) = 0.51 {[}0.06, 1.00{]},
P(\(\beta\) \textgreater{} 0.99)), the model fitted to ungrammatical
conditions did not provide evidence for the effect of number
manipulation (\(\beta\) = -0.05 {[}-0.45, 0.37{]}, P(\(\beta\)
\textgreater{} 0.99)). These results suggest that the presence of a
plural attractor did not increase the acceptability of ungrammatical
sentences, nor was this relationship modulated by grammaticality.

\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  No attraction effect
\item
  There is an unexpected effect, which is might be due to interaction
  between the plausability and the availability of a referent. While the
  plural morpheme can give a general reading, the singular RC probably
  requires an overt referent. It is outside of the scope of this paper.
\end{itemize}

However, both group of accounts generally are underspecified in terms of
how meta-linguistic information should be integrated to the
inter-sentential dependency mechanisms. Recently, a growing literature
have been testing how different types of additional sources that are
independent of the linguistic information affects these errors. Recent
experiments show that even small changes in task expectations can alter
attraction patterns. For example, \citet{LauraMalsbug24} found that
varying the practice structure and task demands (reading vs.~judgment)
affected reading times at the verb in sentences as in (\ref{malsburg}).
In a series of high-powered self-paced reading tasks, they found that
when participants answered a comprehension question after each trial,
reading times at the verb `admires' did not differ between
(\ref{malsburg-singer}) and (\ref{malsburg-singers}). However, when
participants were asked to judge grammaticality instead, they spent more
time reading the verb `admires' in (\ref{malsburg-singers}), suggesting
that processing mechanisms can change depending on the expected task.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{malsburg}
\begin{xlist}
\ex \label{malsburg-singer} The singer that the actor openly admires apparently received broad international recognition.
\ex \label{malsburg-singers} The singers that the actor openly admires apparently received broad international recognition.
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

A related set of findings came from \citet{HammerlyEtAl2019}. They
challenge long-standing assumption that the agreement errors only
surfaced in ungrammatical sentences such as (\ref{og}), but not in
grammatical sentences as in (\ref{og-g}). It has been repeatedly shown
that a plural noun increased participants' likelihood to erroneously
judge ungrammatical sentences as grammatical; however, participants
rarely misidentified grammatical sentences as ungrammatical even when
there is an attractor. \citet{HammerlyEtAl2019} showed that similar
effect surfaced in grammatical sentences when participants' a priori
expectations about the experiment is altered. They manipulated the
instructions and the number of ungrammatical in an experiment so that
participants expected to see more ungrammatical sentences than
grammatical sentences. With reduced bias towards grammaticality, they
found that the presence of a plural nearby noun affected how speakers
completed ungrammatical sentences (\ref{og}) and grammatical sentences
(\ref{og-g}) {[}see TURK2022 for acceptability{]}.

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants-1}

We recruited 95 undergraduate students to participate in the experiment
in exchange for course credit. All participants were native Turkish
speakers, with an average age of 21 (range: 18 -- 30). The experiment
was carried out following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki
and the regulations concerning research ethics at Bogazici University.
All participants provided informed consent before their participation
and their identities were completely anonymised.

\subsection{Materials}\label{materials-1}

The same materials were used with Exp1. We added items from
\citet{TurkLogacev2024} as an additional condition for nominal cases.

\subsection{Procedures}\label{procedures-1}

The same procedure with Experiment 1 was used.

\subsection{Analysis and Results}\label{analysis-and-results-1}

Participants showed high accuracy in both grammatical (M = 0.95, CI =
{[}0.94,0.96{]}) and ungrammatical filler sentences (M = 0.94, CI =
{[}0.93,0.95{]}), indicating that they understood the task and performed
it reliably.

Figure 3 presents the overall means and credible intervals for `yes'
responses across experimental conditions, as well as the previous data
from \citet{TurkLogacev2024}, which is quite similar to the magnitude of
\citet{LagoEtAl2019}. As shown, in our study, participant gave more
`yes' responses to ungrammatical sentences with plural genitive-marked
nominal attractors (M = 0.12, CI = {[}0.09,0.15{]}) compared to their
singular counterparts (M = 0.12, CI = {[}0.09,0.15{]}).

However, similar increase in acceptability was not found with relative
clause attractors (M = 0.05 and 0.05, CI = {[}0.03, 0.07{]} and {[}0.03,
0.07{]} for singular and plural attractors, respectively). Participants
rated grammatical sentences similarly independent of the attractor
number or attractor type.

\caption{Mean proportion of `acceptable' responses by grammaticality,
attractor number and attractor type. Error bars show 95\%

\end{figure}%

Our models also showed similar results, assuming a Bernoulli logit link.
The model was fitted to the binary \emph{yes/no} responses and included
fixed effects for Grammaticality, Attractor Number, and Attractor Type
and their interaction, along with random intercepts and slopes for both
subjects and items. Since our main question was whether
within-experiment statistics affect the grammaticality magnitudes, we
fitted another model with genitive marked nominals from data from our
experiment and \citet{TurkLogacev2024}.

Talk about the important points. not all of them. attraction effect
existed. and it also manipulated as a three way which tells us that
participant only did in a single type.

as for our second model, we present the illusion estimate as a function
of experiment. Attraction:Current, Attraction:TL24

\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion-1}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Goal: test whether attraction changes when both attractor types occur
  in one experiment.
\item
  Participants: 95 Turkish speakers.
\item
  Design: 2 × 2 × 2 (Grammaticality × Attractor Number × Attractor Type
  {[}nominal vs verbal{]}).
\item
  Procedure \& analysis: same as Experiment 1.
\item
  Results:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Attraction replicated for nominal attractors (Δ ≈ 0.07).
  \item
    Verbal attractors again showed null effect.
  \item
    Global decline in yes-responses relative to earlier studies →
    participants became more conservative.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Discussion:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Exposure to verbal conditions reduced attraction magnitude overall.
  \item
    Indicates participants adapt to statistical properties of the task.
  \item
    Aligns with learning-based cue-weighting accounts (Haskell et
    al.~2010).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{General Discussion}\label{general-discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Synthesis:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    No evidence for surface-form matching; effects are feature-based.
  \item
    Attraction magnitude changes with condition distribution → adaptive
    tuning.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Interpretation:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Supports an adaptive parser sensitive to within-experiment
    statistics.
  \item
    Challenges ``shallow'' or ``good-enough'' accounts that attribute
    attraction to phonological overlap.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Broader implication:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Agreement processing is flexible and probabilistic; illusions arise
    from learned cue validity.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Limitations:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Syntactic depth asymmetry (verbal attractors more embedded).
  \item
    Need future designs equating structure (e.g., embedded-object
    attractors).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Conclusion:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Turkish attraction effects arise from abstract feature retrieval not
    surface level shallow form-matching.
  \item
    The evaluation of abstract features are modulated by distributional
    learning within the experiment.
  \end{itemize}
