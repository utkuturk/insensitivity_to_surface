\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Speakers often rely on additional sources of information when processing
sentences, including plausability, frequency, distributional
expectations about forms and tasks, as well as the overall composition
of an experimental session (e.g., the ratio of fillers to critical
items). Recent work has demonstrated that such task or item-specific
factors can substantially modulate reading and judgment behavior
\citep{LauraMalsbug24, ArehalliWittenberg2021, HammerlyEtAl2019, LogacevVasishth2016}.
One line of research has used the agreement-attraction phenomenon to
probe the heuristics that influence sentence processing. Agreement
attraction refers to cases in which a verb erroneously agrees with a
nearby noun rather than the true subject, giving rise to so-called
grammaticality illusions in both production and comprehension
\citep{BockMiller:1991, PearlmutterGarnseyBock:1999}.

\begin{exe}
\ex[*]{\label{og}The key to the cabinets are rusty.} 
\end{exe}

Agreement errors in sentences like (\ref{og}) have been treated either
as a failure of feature reconcilation or a failure of memory encoding.
The former set of accounts explain these errors as a by-product of how
number feature of a phrase is calculated in real-time
\citep{BockMiller:1991, EberhardEtAl2005, HammerlyEtAl2019}. For
example, \citet{EberhardEtAl2005} argue that depending on conceptual
number, morphophonological number marking, or syntactic dependencies
within a phrase, speakers assign a probabilistic number value to
phrases. The errors arise when additional plurality features from
different sources end up contributing to the final number representation
of a phrase. On the other hand, the latter set of accounts claim that
the initial representation is not erroneous, but speakers are sometimes
unable to correctly retrieve the controller
\citep{WagersEtAl:2009, Dillon2013a}. For example,
\citet{WagersEtAl:2009} argue that the parser normally check the
agreement relation by retrieving the relevant chunk in memory using the
retrieval cues provided by the agreement probe. In sentences like (1),
speakers occasionally retrieve the incorrect element due to the fact
that neither nouns fully match the relevant cues.

However, both group of accounts generally are underspecified in terms of
how meta-linguistic information should be integrated to the
inter-sentential dependency mechanisms. Recently, a growing literature
have been testing how different types of additional sources that are
independent of the linguistic information affects these errors. Recent
experiments show that even small changes in task expectations can alter
attraction patterns. For example, \citet{LauraMalsbug24} found that
varying the practice structure and task demands (reading vs.~judgment)
affected reading times at the verb in sentences as in (\ref{malsburg}).
In a series of high-powered self-paced reading tasks, they found that
when participants answered a comprehension question after each trial,
reading times at the verb `admires' did not differ between
(\ref{malsburg-singer}) and (\ref{malsburg-singers}). However, when
participants were asked to judge grammaticality instead, they spent more
time reading the verb `admires' in (\ref{malsburg-singers}), suggesting
that processing mechanisms can change depending on the expected task.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{malsburg}

\ex \label{malsburg-singer} The singer that the actor openly admires apparently received broad international recognition.
\ex \label{malsburg-singers} The singers that the actor openly admires apparently received broad international recognition.
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

A related set of findings came from \citet{HammerlyEtAl2019}. They
challenge long-standing assumption that the agreement errors only
surfaced in ungrammatical sentences such as (\ref{og}), but not in
grammatical sentences as in (\ref{og-g}). It has been repeatedly shown
that a plural noun increased participants' likelihood to erroneously
judge ungrammatical sentences as grammatical; however, participants
rarely misidentified grammatical sentences as ungrammatical even when
there is an attractor. \citet{HammerlyEtAl2019} showed that similar
effect surfaced in grammatical sentences when participants' a priori
expectations about the experiment is altered. They manipulated the
instructions and the number of ungrammatical in an experiment so that
participants expected to see more ungrammatical sentences than
grammatical sentences. With reduced bias towards grammaticality, they
found that the presence of a plural nearby noun affected how speakers
completed ungrammatical sentences (\ref{og}) and grammatical sentences
(\ref{og-g}) \citep[see][ for acceptability]{Turk2022}.

\begin{exe}
\ex[]{\label{og-g}The key to the cabinets is rusty.}
\end{exe}

Another set of meta-linguistic information that comes from form-driven
task strategies. In some languages, surface-form similarity to the
agreement controller can exacerbate attraction {[}BUNCH OF PAPERS{]} or
even drive illusions on its own {[}CHROMY{]}.
\citet{HartsuikerEtAl2003}, for example, used the the accusative marked
determiners' form similarity to the nominative marked articles in
German, that can be the determiner of an agreement controller, and
compared them to distinctively marked dative marked determiners. They
showed that participants made agreement errors more often when the
preambles contained two NPs that are not marked distinctively
(\ref{ger-amb}) compared to cases where the attractor is distinguishable
solely using the form (\ref{ger-dist}). More importantly, this effect
only surfaced when the head and the distractors are both nouns with
feminine gender, and not masculine or neuter gender, which do not show
the surface level similarity in plurals.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ger}
\begin{xlist}
\ex \label{ger-amb}
\gll Die Stellungnahme gegen die Demonstration-en\\
the.F.NOM.SG position against the.F.ACC.PL demonstration-PL\\
\glt `The position against the demonstrations' 
\ex \label{ger-dist}
\gll Die Stellungnahme zu den Demonstration-en\\
the.F.NOM.SG position on the.F.DAT.PL demonstration-PL\\
\glt `the position on the demonstrations' 
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

The most striking evidence comes from work by \citet{Slioussar2018}, who
showed that surface form can sometimes override abstract features in
Russian. Exploiting the syncretism between singular genitives and
nominative plurals, a pattern absent in plural genitives, she found that
participants made more production and comprehension errors and showed
faster reading times in sentences like (\ref{rus-gen-sg}) than in
(\ref{rus-gen-pl}). This finding is fairly surprising given that a noun
that is unambigously singular and only \emph{seems} plural due to form
similarity can induce more attraction errors, than grammatically plural
nouns. She argued that, rather than accessing abstract case features,
speakers and comprehenders sometimes relied on surface-level cues that
were easier to retrieve.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{rus}
\begin{xlist}
\ex \label{rus-gen-sg}
\gll Korobka dlya kraski byla/*byli \ldots \\
box.F.SG.NOM for paint.GEN.SG$_{=NOM.PL}$ be.PST.F.SG/*be.PST.F.PL \\
\glt `A box for the paint(s) was/*were \dots'
\ex \label{rus-gen-pl}
\gll Korobka dlya krasok byla/*byli \ldots \\
box.F.SG.NOM for paint.GEN.PL$_{\neq NOM.PL}$ be.PST.F.SG/*be.PST.F.PL \\
\glt `A box for the paint(s) was/*were \dots'
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Together, these studies converge on the idea that speakers are sensitive
not only to the immediate syntactic cues in a sentence, but also to
broader distributional regularities that shape how those cues are
interpreted. Some of these regularities reflect long-term experience
with the language, such as recurring patterns of form syncretism and
probability of being a controller, while others arise within the course
of a single experiment, as participants adjust to the statistical
composition of the materials, the frequency of ungrammatical items, or
the mix of structure types they encounter. These findings raise the
possibility that agreement attraction is not a fixed structural reflex,
but rather a dynamic outcome of how the processing system weighs and
re-weights cues based on both linguistic and contextual experience. If
so, the strength and even the presence of attraction effects should
depend on how strongly surface form and feature structure are correlated
in the input, and on what participants learn about those correlations in
real time.

Building on these observations, we utilize Turkish as a testing ground
to examine how surface-form overlap influences agreement processing and
whether exposure to different kinds of distractors modulates attraction.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Previous attraction findings in Turkish
\item
  Prior work has reported typical attraction effects with
  genitive-marked nominal attractors, showing higher acceptance of
  ungrammatical plural-verb sentences.
\item
  However, no work has directly tested whether verbal plural morphology
  can induce similar illusions, or how mixing different attractor types
  within an experiment affects the magnitude of attraction.
\end{itemize}

Turkish provides an especially informative case because both nominal and
verbal plural markers are realized with the same morpheme, --lAr, yet
only nominal plurals bear the syntactic features required for agreement.
This allows us to ask whether participants rely on surface-form
similarity or on abstract feature representations when evaluating
agreement.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Morphological properties
\item
  Turkish marks number on both nouns and verbs using the identical
  plural morpheme --lAr.
\item
  Only nominal plurals introduce number features that can agree with the
  verb; verbal --lAr expresses verbal agreement but is not a potential
  controller.
\item
  Because of this homophony, Turkish allows form-overlap and
  feature-mismatch to be disentangled experimentally.
\end{itemize}

In our first experiment, we test whether plural marking on a verbal
distractor---which is morphologically identical but syntactically
irrelevant---can elicit attraction. In the second experiment, we combine
these verbal distractor conditions with standard nominal attractor
conditions to assess how their co-occurrence affects participants'
judgments. If attraction effects reflect flexible, context-sensitive
processing, the inclusion of verbal distractors should dilute or
eliminate the illusion typically observed with nominal attractors.

Together, these experiments extend previous findings on agreement
attraction and task sensitivity in two key ways. First, they show that
surface-level overlap---even when morphologically identical---does not
by itself produce agreement attraction, indicating that participants
rely on abstract morphosyntactic features rather than phonological
forms. Second, they reveal that participants are not only influenced by
the global structure of an experiment (such as the proportion of fillers
or grammatical items) but also by the presence of other condition types
within the same task. In other words, attraction effects are attenuated
when competing, non-attracting conditions are included, suggesting that
agreement processing is dynamically tuned to the statistical context of
the experiment itself.

\subsection{Experimental logic and
predictions}\label{experimental-logic-and-predictions}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Goal 1: test whether purely form-based overlap (verbal --lAr) elicits
  attraction.
\item
  Prediction: if attraction is driven by form, verbal plural distractors
  should yield higher ``acceptable'' rates for ungrammatical plurals.
\item
  Alternative: if attraction depends on abstract features, no effect of
  verbal --lAr should appear.
\item
  Goal 2: test whether the co-occurrence of different attractor types
  modulates attraction.
\item
  Prediction: if participants adapt to the distribution of conditions,
  adding verbal distractors (which share the plural form but lack
  agreement features) should attenuate or eliminate the
  nominal-attractor illusion.
\item
  Summary: These experiments jointly test whether agreement attraction
  in Turkish reflects shallow form matching or feature-based computation
  that is sensitive to the statistical context of the task.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiment 1: Testing Form-Driven
Processing}\label{experiment-1-testing-form-driven-processing}

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}

We recruited 80 undergraduate students to participate in the experiment
in exchange for course credit. All participants were native Turkish
speakers, with an average age of 21 (range: 18 -- 31). The experiment
was carried out following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki
and the regulations concerning research ethics at Bogazici University.
All participants provided informed consent before their participation
and their identities were completely anonymised.

\subsection{Materials}\label{materials}

We used 40 sets of sentences like (\ref{exp}), in which we manipulated
(i) the number of the attractor and (ii) the number agreement on the
verb. Both plural markings were marked with the suffix -ler/-lar, while
the singular number and singular agreement were marked by its absence.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{exp}
\begin{xlist}
\ex[]{\label{ss}
\gll Tut-tuğ-u aşçı mutfak-ta sürekli zıpla-dı.\\
hire-NMLZ-POSS cook[NOM] kitchen-LOC non.stop jump-PST\\
\glt `The cook they hired$_{sg}$ jumped$_{sg}$ in the kitchen non-stop.'}
\ex[*]{\label{sp}
\gll Tut-tuğ-u aşçı mutfak-ta sürekli zıpla-dı-lar.\\
hire-NMLZ-POSS cook[NOM] kitchen-LOC non.stop jump-PST-PL\\
\glt `The cook they hired$_{sg}$ jumped$_{pl}$ in the kitchen non-stop.'}
\ex[]{\label{ps}
\gll Tut-tuk-lar-ı aşçı mutfak-ta sürekli zıpla-dı.\\
hire-NMLZ-PL-POSS cook[NOM] kitchen-LOC non.stop jump-PST\\
\glt `The cook they hired$_{pl}$ jumped$_{sg}$ in the kitchen non-stop.'}
\ex[*]{\label{pp}
\gll Tut-tuk-lar-ı aşçı mutfak-ta sürekli zıpla-dı-lar.\\
hire-NMLZ-PL-POSS cook[NOM] kitchen-LOC non.stop jump-PST-PL\\
\glt `The cook they hired$_{pl}$ jumped$_{pl}$ in the kitchen non-stop.'}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

All sentences were adapted by previous studies in Turkish agreement
attraction \citep{LagoEtAl2019, TurkLogacev2020}. Sentences started with
a complex subject NP like `tuttukları aşçı' `the cook they hired,' in
which the nominalized relative clause functioned as the attractor, and
the head noun were bare. Because the plural marking on nominals is not
optional and the head noun was singular, absent of -lar, in all
conditions, sentences with plural verb agreement were ungrammatical. To
inhibit participants from forming a task-related strategy in which they
deemed the sentence ungrammatical upon seeing a plural verb, half of our
fillers included plural grammatical verbs, while the other half included
singular ungrammatical verbs.

\subsection{Procedures}\label{procedures}

The experiment was run online, using the web-based platform Ibex Farm
\citep{Drummond2013}. Each experimental session took approximately 25
minutes to complete. Participants provided demographic information and
gave informed consent to participate in the experiment. They then
proceeded to read the instructions and were given nine practice trials
before the experiment began.

Each trial began with a blank screen for 600 ms, followed by a
word-by-word RSVP presentation of the sentence in the center of the
screen, followed by a prompt to indicate their acceptability judgment.
Sentences were presented word-by-word in the center of the screen in 30
pt font size, at a rate of 400 ms per word. Participants saw a blank
screen for 100 ms between each word, and to see the next item, they
needed to press the space key. Participants were asked to press the key
P to indicate that a sentence is acceptable and Q to indicate that the
sentence is unacceptable. They were instructed to provide judgments as
quickly as possible. During the practice, but not during the experiment,
a warning message in red font appeared if they did not respond within
5,000 ms.

Participants saw 40 experimental and 40 filler sentences. Experimental
sentences were distributed among four different lists according to a
Latin-square design. Every participant saw one version of the experiment
with a specific list and one item per condition.

\end{itemize}

\section{Experiment 2: Testing Within-Experiment Statistical
Sensitivity}\label{experiment-2-testing-within-experiment-statistical-sensitivity}

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants-1}

We recruited 118 undergraduate students to participate in the experiment
in exchange for course credit. All participants were native Turkish
speakers, with an average age of 20 (range: 18 -- 32). The experiment
was carried out following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki
and the regulations concerning research ethics at Bogazici University.
All participants provided informed consent before their participation
and their identities were completely anonymised.

\subsection{Materials}\label{materials-1}

The same materials were used with Exp1. We added items from
TurkLogacev2024 as an additional condition.

\subsection{Procedures}\label{procedures-1}

The same procedure with Experiment 1 was used.

\subsection{Analysis and Results}\label{analysis-and-results-1}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Goal: test whether attraction changes when both attractor types occur
  in one experiment.
\item
  Participants: 95 Turkish speakers.
\item
  Design: 2 × 2 × 2 (Grammaticality × Attractor Number × Attractor Type
  {[}nominal vs verbal{]}).
\item
  Procedure \& analysis: same as Experiment 1.
\item
  Results:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Attraction replicated for nominal attractors (Δ ≈ 0.07).
  \item
    Verbal attractors again showed null effect.
  \item
    Global decline in yes-responses relative to earlier studies →
    participants became more conservative.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Discussion:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Exposure to verbal conditions reduced attraction magnitude overall.
  \item
    Indicates participants adapt to statistical properties of the task.
  \item
    Aligns with learning-based cue-weighting accounts (Haskell et
    al.~2010).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{General Discussion}\label{general-discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Synthesis:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    No evidence for surface-form matching; effects are feature-based.
  \item
    Attraction magnitude changes with condition distribution → adaptive
    tuning.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Interpretation:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Supports an adaptive parser sensitive to within-experiment
    statistics.
  \item
    Challenges ``shallow'' or ``good-enough'' accounts that attribute
    attraction to phonological overlap.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Broader implication:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Agreement processing is flexible and probabilistic; illusions arise
    from learned cue validity.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Limitations:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Syntactic depth asymmetry (verbal attractors more embedded).
  \item
    Need future designs equating structure (e.g., embedded-object
    attractors).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Conclusion:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Turkish attraction effects arise from abstract feature retrieval not
    surface level shallow form-matching.\\
  \item
    The evaluation of abstract features are modulated by distributional
    learning within the experiment.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
