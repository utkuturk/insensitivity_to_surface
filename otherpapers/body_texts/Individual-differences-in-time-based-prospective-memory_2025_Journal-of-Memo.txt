Introduction
Prospective memory (PM) refers to the ability to remember and
execute intended actions at a designated future moment. When studying
PM, one can differentiate between event-based and time-based PM tasks.
Event-based PM, involves executing an intended action in response to a
specific event, such as posting a letter when passing the next mailbox or
telling a colleague something important the next time one sees her.
Time-based PM involves executing an intended action at a predetermined future time point, like remembering a dentist appointment
at 11 am or remembering to meet a friend for coffee at 3 pm (Einstein &
McDaniel, 1990; McDaniel & Einstein, 2007). From these everyday examples, it becomes evident that both types of PM tasks play an important
role for goal-directed behavior in daily life (Ball et al., 2019; Rummel
et al., 2023) and it is thus crucial to understand which cognitive demands PM tasks place on the individual and also which cognitive processes underlie the successful execution of these tasks. Research on PM,
and especially its cognitive underpinnings, has flourished over the past
three decades, with a steady increase in publications each year (Rummel
& McDaniel, 2019, for a recent overview). However, many of these
publications have been focusing on event-based PM and thus the
cognitive underpinnings of time-based PM are currently less well understood. This discrepancy is remarkable considering that in everyday

life most PM tasks are time-based (Kvavilashvili & Fisher, 2007). In the
present article, we thus investigated which general cognitive and task
specific abilities enable people to fulfill their time-based PM tasks.
A fundamental aspect of both event-based and time-based PM tasks is
that they require the individual to maintain the intended action over
time while being engaged in other activities or tasks (Ellis, 1996; Ellis &
Kvavilashvili, 2000; Smith et al., 2017). In laboratory settings, the tasks
participants perform while awaiting the right moment for executing the
delayed intention are referred to as ongoing tasks. Oftentimes these
ongoing tasks require continuous responding, like classifying stimuli
according to certain rules (Einstein & McDaniel, 1990). Event-based PM
tasks can be introduced in the setting by simply asking participants to
press a special key when a specific event happens (e.g., when a predefined stimulus appears on the screen). Time-based PM tasks can be
introduced similarly by asking participants to press a special key when a
certain amount of time has elapsed (Einstein et al., 1995). In time-based
PM tasks, participants are usually provided with opportunities to
monitor the time via a clock that can be accessed on demand. A critical
feature of both event-based and time-based laboratory PM settings is
that the PM task has to be executed only infrequently, that is, on only 5
% − 10 % of the ongoing task trials (Ellis & Kvavilashvili, 2000). The
rate of correct responses to the critical events or at the critical time
points is usually considered a measure of PM performance (Einstein &

McDaniel, 1990).
Whereas the exact nature of the cognitive processes underlying PM is
still an issue of debate, there is a consensus that PM performance often
relies on top-down processes (e.g., monitoring the environment for the
right moment to fulfill the PM task), although there is some evidence
that very salient and focal stimuli can also activate the PM intention in a
bottom-up fashion (McDaniel et al., 2015; Shelton & Scullin, 2017;
Smith et al., 2014; Strickland et al., 2018; Rummel & Kvavilashvili,
2023, for a discussion of current PM theories). General cognitive abilities like working-memory (WM) are sometimes considered a bottleneck
for top-down monitoring processes (Smith & Bayen, 2005). In line with
this notion, event-based PM performance regularly suffers under
experimentally increased WM load (Einstein et al., 1997; Gonneaud
et al., 2011; Kidder et al., 1997; Logie et al., 2004; Marsh & Hicks, 1998;
Meier & Zimmermann, 2015; Park et al., 1997). The same pattern but
with fewer studies can be found in time-based PM (Khan et al., 2008;
Martin & Schumann-Hengsteler, 2001). Furthermore, it has been
repeatedly shown that people with higher WM capacity also show better
event-based PM performance (Kidder et al., 1997; Rose et al., 2010;
Smith et al., 2011; Smith & Bayen, 2005). However, as said, it remains
an open question which insights from event-based PM studies can
directly be transferred to time-based PM. Indeed, it has been argued that
the cognitive demands from event-based and time-based PM tasks differ
in some respects. For instance, as there are no external events cuing the
moment for intention execution in time-based tasks, their performance
supposedly requires more self-initiated mental reactivation of the PM
intention and a more continuous monitoring of the right moment to
fulfill the intention. That is, one can assume that time-based PM relies on
a general cognitive ability to maintain future task goals in WM and to
monitor the time while performing some ongoing task (Kvavilashvili &
Fisher, 2007). It is therefore crucial to understand which general
cognitive abilities are associated with PM and how these processes influence task specific abilities, like monitoring behavior. Indeed, the few
studies which have investigated the role of WM for time-based PM,
found PM performance to decrease with increased WM load (Voigt et al.,
2014) and time-based PM performance to be positively associated with
WM capacity (Kretschmer et al., 2014; Mioni et al., 2017). Furthermore,
there is empirical evidence that more efficient time monitoring goes
along with better time-based PM performance (Joly-Burra et al., 2022).
In the present studies, we were primarily interested inasmuch WM
processes are crucial for time-based PM and we used both experimental
and individual difference approaches to address this issue. In Experiment 1, we manipulated WM capacity load during the ongoing task by
systematically increasing it across three groups to examine the effects on
time-based PM and on strategic clock checking behavior. In Experiment
2, we assessed WM capacity by measuring specific WM subprocesses.
Specifically, drawing on previous research indicating their relevance for
both time-based and event-based PM, we focused on updating (Kliegel
et al., 2002; Mioni & Stablum, 2014; Zuber et al., 2019) and binding
abilities (Lecouvey et al., 2017; Morand et al., 2021). In Experiment 3,
we experimentally manipulated different types of WM load, increasing
either capacity load or updating-specific load.
As said, there are likely general cognitive abilities (WM) and taskspecific abilities (time monitoring) contributing to successful timebased PM performance. One open question from previous studies
investigating the association between WM and time-based PM is
whether WM and time monitoring contribute independently to timebased PM or whether people with better WM are simply better able to
monitor the time and thus show better PM performance. Therefore, in
the present studies, in addition to manipulating WM load or assessing
WM capacity we also assessed time monitoring and tested whether
eventually observed relationships between WM and time-based PM
would remain stable after controlling for individual differences in time
monitoring efficiency.
In addition to cognitive factors, non-cognitive factors like personality
traits are believed to contribute to successful PM performance. However,

these factors appear to be less strong predictors of PM (Arana et al.,
2008) and the evidence surrounding them is somewhat contradictory.
While some studies have found significant associations between certain
personality traits and PM performance, others have not (Uttl et al.,
2018). For instance, research has shown relationships between conscientiousness (Arana et al., 2008; Cuttler & Graf, 2007; Smith et al., 2011;
Uttl et al., 2013), neuroticism (Cuttler & Graf, 2007), agreeableness, and
openness (Uttl et al., 2013) and PM performance. However, a study with
a large sample of 1170 participants found that personality traits did not
significantly improve the prediction of PM performance beyond the
variance that was already explained by cognitive factors (Uttl et al.,
2018). In addition, self-reported PM abilities have been shown to be a
reliable and valid way for assessing PM abilities, capturing individual
differences (Rummel et al., 2019). Further investigation is needed to
explore how these non-cognitive factors might interact with cognitive
processes to influence PM outcomes. Consequently, we included personality traits and self-reported PM ability as additional individual difference variables in our studies.
To enable participants to monitor the time in laboratory time-based
PM tasks, participants are typically provided with the opportunity to
periodically check a screen clock display by pressing a key (Vanneste
et al., 2016). This clock checking behavior is essential for determining
the correct time for intention execution (Labelle et al., 2009; Mioni et al.,
2020) and typically follows a J-shaped curve, with clock checking
occurring more frequently when the right moment to execute the PM
task gets closer (Einstein et al., 1995). In a time-based PM task, two
different measures of clock checking behavior can be derived: absolute
and strategic clock checking. Absolute clock checking is the absolute
frequency with which the clock has been checked within the PM-critical
time interval (i.e., if the PM task was to press a special key every five
minutes, the critical time interval would be five minutes). Strategic clock
checking considers that time monitoring is more efficient when it happens closer to the moment where the PM task shall be executed. It has
been proposed to calculate a relative measure of clock checks by
comparing the number of checks made closer to the PM execution time
to the total number of checks in each block (Joly-Burra et al., 2022).
Both absolute and strategic clock checking behaviors have been shown
to be predictive of PM performance (Joly-Burra et al., 2022; Mioni &
Stablum, 2014; Vanneste et al., 2016).
In event-based PM task, strategic slowing of ongoing task responding
has been suggested as another task-specific strategic processes towards
good PM performance. Specifically, slowing in ongoing task responding
is often found when performances between conditions with and without
an additional PM task are compared (Heathcote et al., 2015; Smith,
2003, 2010). Again, it might be plausible that any observed relationship
between WM and time-based PM is due to the fact that people with
higher WM capacity are more strategic in their ongoing task slowing and
thus show better PM. Therefore, we also assessed and controlled for
strategic slowing when investigating the relationship between timebased PM and WM. As a strategic slowing measure we used ongoing
task response speed closer to the PM execution time and further
compared it to response speed earlier in the block.
Open Science and data availability
All three experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of
Heidelberg University and conducted in compliance with the principles
of the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave informed consent
prior to their participation. All methods, hypotheses and analyses were
preregistered prior to data collection on the OSF (https://osf.
io/2yp4e/). Deviations from preregistered analyses are reported and
explained when the analyses are introduced in each experiment. All
materials, data and analysis code that we produced ourselves are provided via the OSF (link above). We do not provide program code for the
WM tasks we used in Experiment 2 because it was programmed by
Lewandowsky et al. (2010).

Experiment 1

food and tree categories that were specific to Spain and possibly unknown to German participants leaving a sample of 293 words and
matching pictures. On each trial, a white screen was presented for variable amount of time (i.e., either 300, 400, 500, 600 or 700 ms) first.
Then participants were shown a set of words for 1200 ms in black in
front of a white background. The set size varied depending on the
condition between two words (low load group); four words (medium
load group); or six words (high load group). For all groups, after the set
was presented, the location of one of the previously presented words was
marked with a red cross, indicating that this word should be evaluated
against the picture shown afterwards. Half of the pictures matched the
cued word, while the remaining half either matched a different word
shown earlier in the current trial but wasn’t marked (25 % of trials) or
matched a word that was not presented in the current trial (25 % of
trials). Both words and pictures were selected randomly from a list in
each trial. The picture to match the previously shown word was on
display until a response key was pressed. Participants were instructed to
press the J-key for a match or the F-key for a non-match as quickly and
accurately as possible.
PM Task. Participants were instructed to remember to press the
Enter key and type in a word every 5 min during the ongoing task. They
were instructed that, if the keypress for the PM task was on time, a
response window would open and they would have to enter a target
word (i.e.,”medal”). By adding this task we hoped to separate the PM
component (remember the keypress) from the retrospective component
(remember target word) (Cohen et al., 2003). The response window for
the PM task was +/- 30 s around the target time point but participants
were unaware of that. If the Enter key was pressed at any time outside
the response window, the ongoing task was interrupted for 2 s to indicate that the keypress was registered but occurred outside the response
window.
To monitor the time, participants could press the spacebar at any
time during the ongoing task in order to display a screen clock (“00:00”).
The number of screen clock showings was not limited but the ongoing
task was interrupted while the screen clock was on display for 2 s.

In the first experiment, we examined the influence of WM capacity
load imposed by the ongoing task on time-based PM performance. We
realized three different load conditions and also assessed time monitoring in terms of clock checking during the ongoing task.
Method
Participants
A total of 153 young adults participated in this study, either for
course credit or monetary compensation. Six participants were excluded
because of software failure, because they did not adhere to the instructions, because they deliberately did not complete the PM task or
withdrew their consent after participation, resulting in a sample of 147
participants (18–34 years, Mage = 22.13, SD = 3.53; 70.7 % female).
Sample size was planned based on the recommendations for sufficient
sample sizes for multilevel modeling provided by Maas and Hox (2005),
indicating that a sample size of 50 participants per group can yield accurate estimates of regression coefficients and variance components.
Additionally, the decision was informed by the simulation studies conducted by Paccagnella (2011).
In a between-subjects design, we manipulated WM load in the
ongoing task load across three groups: a high load (N = 50), a medium
load (N = 49), and a low load group (N = 48). Participants were
randomly assigned to a group.
Tasks
Ongoing Task. A word-picture matching task was used as an
ongoing task in the present study (see Fig. 1). Participants performing
this task had to determine whether a presented picture matched a
highlighted word from a previous set of two, four or six words
(depending on the assigned group). Ongoing task stimuli were derived
from the ecological stimulus set by Moreno-Martínez and Montoro
(2012). This set contains 360 pictures and matching words. Stimuli from
the categories body parts, insects and weapons were excluded in anticipation of interference of arousal. We further excluded stimuli from the

Procedure
The study was advertised as a WM study without giving details about
the PM task beforehand to avoid a primary focus on the PM task. The
ongoing task and the PM task were introduced as equally important in
the laboratory. The experiment was programmed in PsychoPy 2022.2.5
(Peirce, 2007). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three
experimental groups. For all participants, the experiment started with
instructions for the ongoing task and a practice block of 5 trials. Then
participants continued with the ongoing task. The ongoing task consisted of 9 blocks each lasting 5 min making the experiments duration
about 50 min including instructions. The first was a baseline block to
familiarize participants with the ongoing task (not analyzed in the
present study), the following eight consecutive blocks included the PM
task. At the end of the PM experiment, participants were asked to rate
how difficult they found it to remember the PM task on a 7-point Likert
scale (from “not difficult” to “very difficult”). Additionally, they were
asked to select a reason why they did not remember to execute the PM
task every time (remembered PM task too late, forgotten, not executed
on purpose, never forgotten to execute PM task).

(prospective component) and remembering the word correctly (retrospective component). The result of this exploratory analysis suggested
that there was no difference in prospective and retrospective performance, that is, that if participants remembered the PM task, they also
remembered to type in the correct word. One participant appeared to
have misunderstood the instructions and wrote random words as the PM
task instead of the target word every time. One participant wrote no
word instead of the target word twice and another participant wrote no
word once, but in every other successful PM trial the target word was
remembered successfully. Therefore, contrary to the preregistered
analysis, we used only the prospective instead of the retrospective
component as a measure of PM performance, because it directly corresponds to the primary focus of our research question, which revolves
around understanding and predicting the prospective component of PM
performance. Generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMM) were
utilized, to account for random effects and the binary nature of PM
performance with a random intercept for participants (1 | participant),
and the binary-coded PM performance (1 = successful intention fulfillment, 0 = unsuccessful intention fulfillment) as dependent variable. We
used the lme4 package, version 1.1–33 (Bates et al., 2015). As we found
a general trend in improvement in PM performance throughout the
experiment, as preregistered, block number was introduced as a control
variable (coded numerically and centered, − 3.5, − 2.5, − 1.5, − 0.5, 0.5,
1.5, 2.5, 3.5 for blocks 1–8, respectively).
To assess load effects on the PM performance, we applied the same
contrasts as for the ongoing tasks analyses—namely, Ψlinear = (0.5, 0,
− 0.5) and Ψquadratic = (− 0.5, 1, − 0.5). We used the z-test of regression
weights to evaluate significance of model predictors. To test whether
strategic clock checking was functionally related to PM performance, we
included z-standardized strategic clock checking as an additional blocklevel predictor in the PM performance analysis in a stepwise fashion and
compared the models using the chi-square test for model comparison to
identify the model with the best fit. We calculated McFadden’s R2pseudo as
a measure for the variance in the dichotomous criterion explained by the
predictors (McFadden, 1973). This measure can be interpreted similar to
R2. According to McFadden (1977) values above 0.2 to 0.4 indicate an
excellent model fit. To maintain methodological consistency, we deviated from the preregistration and performed frequentist analyses instead
of a Bayesian approach across all experiments.

Statistical analyses & dependent variables
We used the software R, version 4.2.2 (R Core Team, 2022) for data
cleaning and analyses. We applied an alpha level of.05 for all statistical
tests. We used accuracy rates and response times (RTs) as dependent
variables in these analyses. For the RT analyses, only correct responses
were analyzed and responses faster than 150 ms and those exceeding 2.5
standard deviations from participants’ mean RT were excluded. For the
analyses of ongoing task performance, we conducted one-way analyses
of variance (ANOVAs) with load group as between-subjects factor and
accuracies and RTs as dependent variables. In addition to preregistered
analyses, whenever there was an overall effect of load, we followed up
with a trend analysis to interpret the direction of the effect. This analysis
tested whether performance would linearly change with increasing load
from low to medium to high load, Ψlinear = (0.5, 0, − 0.5), and whether
the medium load group would deviate from the linear trend, Ψquadratic =
(− 0.5, 1, − 0.5).
For clock checking analyses, we also conducted one-way ANOVAs
with load group as between-subjects factor and clock checking frequency and strategicness as dependent variables. Clock checking frequency was assessed as the number of spacebar presses per block.
Contrary to preregistered analyses, instead of considering clock checks
per minute as strategicness measures, we used a measure suggested by
Joly-Burra et al. (2022). To this end, we further divided each 5-minute
block into four segments of equal duration (S1- S4) and calculated
strategicness by dividing the number of clock checks in the last segment
before the PM timeframe (S4) by the total number of clock checks within
the block and multiplied it by 100. This results in a measure ranging
from 0 to 100 which we considered as a predictor in the PM analyses. In
doing so, we are able to account for individual differences in clock
checking frequency. Furthermore, this measure better captures the
temporal dynamics of clock checking than traditional measures, especially in relation to proximity to the PM task (see also Joly-Burra et al.,
(2022) for additional advantages of this measure) (Joly-Burra et al.,
2022; Laera et al., 2024).
We conducted exploratory analyses to test for a relationship between
PM performance and strategic ongoing task slowing. The analysis
focused on blocks with successful PM performances because PM performance was generally very high in the low and medium load groups
and we thus did not have enough observations of PM misses. In each
block, we considered mean RTs in S3 and S4 as a dependent variable and
conducted a 3 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA with load group (low,
medium and high load) as between-subjects factor and RTs in S3 and S4
as within-subject factors.
For further analyses of PM performance, we conducted a Fisher’s
exact test to assess whether there was a difference between remembering the PM task to press the Enter key within the right time window

Results & discussion
Mean accuracies, RTs of the ongoing task, clock checking strategicness, clock checking frequencies, and frequencies of correct responses in
the PM task, are displayed in Table 1. We found a significant load effect
on ongoing task accuracy, F(2, 144) = 91.28, p < .001, η2 = .56, with a
the linear trend, t(144) = 13.44, p < .001, whereas the quadratic trend
was not significant, t(144) = 1.57, p = .12, suggesting a linear decline in
accuracy with increasing ongoing task difficulty. We found a load effect
on RTs, F(2, 144) = 12.31, p < .001, η2 = .15, displaying both a significant linear trend, t(144) = -4.43, p < .001, and quadratic trend, t
(144) = 2.18, p = .03, indicating a curve-linear effect with a stronger
increase from low to medium than from medium to high load group.
These results suggest that load has detrimental effects on RTs, and the
curve-linear trend implies that while RTs generally increase with load,
this effect becomes less pronounced as load reaches higher levels. Clock
checking strategicness did not differ between load groups, F(2, 144) =
0.54, p = .58. Clock checking frequency varied with load group, F(2,
144) = 5.27, p = .006, η2 = .07, with a significant linear trend, t(144) =
3.08, p = .002, and a non-significant quadratic trend, t(144) = -0.99, p =
.32. These results suggest that participants check the clock less
frequently, when the ongoing task load is increased while remaining
equally strategic in their clock checking behavior across groups. Thus, it
is possible that ongoing task load only influences the number of clock
checks while having no effect on the strategicness with which participants check the clock.

When analyzing ongoing task slowing, we found a significant effect
of group, F(2, 142) = 11.47, p < .001, η2G = .14, indicating that there
were differences in RTs in S3 and S4 among the three load groups. These
findings are in line with the differences in RTs between groups reported
earlier. Similarly, a significant effect of segment was found, F(1, 142) =
15.84, p < .001, η2G = .003. Post-hoc analyses suggest that there were
differences in RTs between segment “S3” and segment “S4” which is
immediately prior the PM intention fulfillment. The interaction between
group and segment was not significant, F(2, 142) = 0.67, p = .514,
suggesting that the amount of slowing prior to the moment of PM
execution did not vary significantly between groups (Fig. 2).
In a next step, we used GLMMs to analyze the dependent variable PM
performance. Our baseline model included the random intercept for
participant and the detrending factor of block number, which was significant for all reported models. For the following models, we added the
predictors load group, strategic clock checking and their interaction in a
stepwise fashion. First, we specified an experimental effects model with
the factor load group and found a significant linear trend, b = 0.97, SE =
0.33, z = 2.91, p = .004, but no quadratic trend, b = -0.13, SE = 0.56, z
= -0.23, p = .819. The comparison to the baseline model showed a
significant difference in model fit in favor of our experimental effects
model, χ2(2) = 8.93, p = .01; R2pseudo = .04. These results indicate an
influence of load group on PM performance, namely that our load
manipulation results in a decrease in PM performance when ongoing
task load increases. However, the low model fit also indicates that large
proportions of the variance in PM remained unexplained. Second, we
included the additional block-level predictor strategic clock checking.
The linear effect of load group remained significant, b = 0.730, SE =
0.364, z = 2.003, p = .045. Strategic clock checking had a significant

effect as well, b = 1.988, SE = 0.214, z = 9.296, p < .001. We compared
this model to the experimental effects model and found a significant
difference in model fit in favor of our model including the block level
predictor, χ2(1) = 168.46, p < .001; R2pseudo = .32. These results suggest
that strategicness in clock checking during the ongoing task has an influence on PM performance in addition to the load manipulation.
Finally, we also allowed for the interactions between the significant
predictors and tested whether this model would fit the data better than
the model without interactions. The chi-square test showed a significant
difference in model fit, χ2(2) = 12.09, p = .002; R2pseudo = .34, in favor of
our final model including block level predictor and interactions. We
found significant effects for clock checking strategicness, for the interaction between clock checking strategicness and the linear trend in the
load group and for the detrending variable block number, while the
linear trend alone was no longer significant (Table 2) with still excellent
model fit.
The significant interaction between load group and clock checking
strategicness indicates a different influence of strategic clock checking
on PM performance for the different load groups. As evident from Fig. 3
the influence of clock checking strategicness became stronger when
ongoing task load increased. This suggests that participants may rely
more on strategic clock checking to manage their time more effectively
when facing high ongoing task load. Although a similar pattern can be
seen for absolute clock checking (Fig. 4), where the influence of absolute
clock checking again became stronger with increasing load, absolute
clock checking lacks the differentiated temporal focus seen in strategic
time monitoring. Strategic clock checking not only reflects when participants check the clock relative to the target time but also accounts for
individual differences in time monitoring behavior. Given the variability
in clock checks across participants (ranging from 0 to 28 clock checks
per block, for means for each group: see Table 1), strategic clock
checking provides a better interpretable and standardized measure,
allowing for a better comparison between participants.
Experiment 2
In Experiment 1, we found that time-based PM performance decreases when WM load increases. Despite the fact that we used a rather
unspecific load manipulation, McFadden’s pseudo R2 for the final model
suggested a good model fit, R2pseudo = .340. However, a further
improvement in model fit may be achieved by considering individual
differences in different WM sub-processes. To shed light on the question
of which WM sub-processes contribute to this effect, we conducted a
second study in which we adopted an individual difference approach. It
has been shown, that WM capacity in general (Ball et al., 2019; Smith &
Bayen, 2005), and specifically better binding (Lecouvey et al., 2017;
Morand et al., 2021) and updating abilities (Kliegel et al., 2002; Mäntylä
et al., 2007; Mioni & Stablum, 2014; Voigt et al., 2014; Yang et al.,
2011), are associated with time-based and event-based PM performance
(but see also Schnitzspahn et al., 2013). Based on this previous research,
one can assume that the WM-load-induced time-based PM decrements
we observed in Experiment 1, may have been either due to a load effect
on binding, updating, or both binding and updating processes. Therefore, in Experiment 2, we had participants perform the high-load time-

(Oberauer, 2005; Wilhelm et al., 2013). So, we also employed an
operation span task as a widely utilized as a reference task to measure
WM capacity (Lewandowsky et al., 2010).
With this study design, we aimed to test whether these abilities
would be associated with time-based PM and, if so, whether their association would differ in magnitude. In addition to WM capacity, previous studies suggest that conscientiousness (Arana et al., 2008) and
self-reported PM abilities (Rummel et al., 2019) can explain differences
in event-based PM performance. To test whether this would also hold for
time-based PM and to potentially increase the proportion of explainable
variance in time-based PM performance, we assessed these variables as
well.
Method
Participants
Either for course credit or monetary compensation, 145 young adults
who had not participated in Experiment 1, participated in this study.
Five participants were excluded prior to analyses because of software
failure or because they withdrew consent after participation. Two participants were excluded because they deliberately ignored the PM task
while performing the ongoing tasks. Following the exclusion criteria
proposed by Lewandowsky et al. (2010), six participants scoring zero
percent in the WM tasks in either the updating or operation span tasks
were also excluded. Additionally, one participant’s performance in the
operation span task was more than 3 standard deviations below the
sample mean. However, as their performance in other WM tasks was
satisfactory, all observations from this participant were retained. This
left a sample of 132 participants (18 – 34 years, Mage = 22.52, SD = 3.14;
74.2 % female).
Sample size was determined based on the data from Experiment 1
using the shiny app by Murayama, Usami and Sakaki (2022). The
objective was to achieve a statistical power of.80 for predictors with zvalues equal to or exceeding 3.00, with a significance level of.05. This
analysis resulted in a recommended sample size of 133 participants.

Tasks
All WM tasks were programmed and run in MATLAB R2018b (The
MathWorks Inc, 2018). Data from the questionnaires for conscientiousness and self-reported PM performance were collected online in the
lab with SoSci Survey (Leiner, 2023). The PM task was again programmed in PsychoPy 2022.2.5 (Peirce, 2007).
Updating Task. This task is one of the four tasks included in the WM
test battery by Lewandowsky et al. (2010). In this task, participants had
to remember an initial set of digits displayed in separate frames on a
screen and update them using arithmetic operations. On each trial, a set
of frames of different set sizes (three, four or five frames) each with two,
three, four, five, and six updating operations was presented. Resulting in
a total of 15 test trials preceded by two practice trials. The first digits
were displayed in frames for 1 s each. Then, cues for arithmetic operations such as “- 3″ or ”+ 5″ appeared for 1300 ms each, followed by a 250
ms interval. Participants were to apply the shown operations to the
previously displayed digits in the same frame and to replace the content

based PM task from Experiment 1 and also assessed WM capacity of
these participants with multiple tasks. Using multiple tasks to assess WM
capacity can reduce the influence of task specific variance and error
variance, thereby increasing the reliability and validity of the measure.
The variance observed in performance on one task may be more
reflective of the task specific demands rather than the underlying
construct of WM capacity. By using multiple tasks, we aim to capture a
broader range of cognitive processes involved in WM and thereby gain a
more nuanced understanding of an individual’s WM abilities
(Lewandowsky et al., 2010). To investigate the specific WM processes
relevant for PM, we used a binding and an updating task. Binding tasks
and updating tasks load high on the general WM capacity factor

mentally with the result. After the updating operations, question marks
appeared in the frames indicating the final recall. Operations ranged
from − 7 to + 7, excluding 0, with intermediate and final results between 1 and 9. The set of initial digits, operations, updating, recall
prompt, and trial orders were randomly generated but held constant for
all participants to control for between-subjects error variance (Goodhew
& Edwards, 2019).
Operation Span Task. This task is also one of the four tasks included
in the WM test battery by Lewandowsky et al. (2010). In the operation
span task, developed by Turner and Engle (1989), participants alternately were to evaluate the correctness of arithmetic equations (e.g. 4 +
2 = 6) and to remember the subsequent consonants (except Y and Q).
Trials began with a 1.5-second fixation cross followed by an equation.
Participants were to judge the equation by responding within 3 s with
the right arrow key for correct and the left arrow key for incorrect. After
the equation disappeared, a consonant appeared for 1 s and had to be
encoded for later recall. After 4 to 8 consonants were presented, participants were to recall the letters in the presented order. Trials were
separated by a 500 ms interval, with pauses every 3 trials. There were 15
trials: 3 per trial list length (number of letters to be remembered). The
equations featured numbers from − 9 to 10, except 0, with results from 1
to 20. Half of the equations were correct. Three practice trials (trial list
length 3, 4, 5 letters) preceded the experimental trials. Letter sequences,
equations and trial order were in a fixed random order for all participants. The consonant lists had no repetitions.
Binding Task. We used the location-letter binding task, where participants remembered the positions of letters sequentially presented in a
3 × 3 grid. This task was derived from Wilhelm et al. (2013). During
recall, participants were either presented with a letter and had to indicated the letter’s location within the grid or were presented with a
location and had to selected the correct letter for this specific grid
location. The complexity varied from 2 to 6 location-letter pairs, with a
total of 14 trials. Stimuli appeared for 1500 ms with a 500 ms inter
stimulus interval. There was no time limit for the response.
Conscientiousness. To measure conscientiousness, we used the
eight respective items of the German version of the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP40). It is an open access measure that has high
convergent validities with the German version of the NEO-FFI (Hartig
et al., 2003).
Self-Reported PM Abilities. We measured self-reported PM performance by using the Short Version of the Metacognitive Prospective
Memory Inventory (MPMI-s). This questionnaire measures individual
differences in self-reported PM abilities as well as the utilization of both
internal and external strategic approaches to PM tasks in everyday life.
(Rummel et al., 2019).

asking participants to simply press a special key at designated times. For
correct PM responses, participants received feedback on the screen, that
their keypress was successful and automatically returned to the next
block of the ongoing task. The ongoing task with the embedded PM task
lasted 45 min and consisted of a 5-minute baseline block followed by
eight 5-minute PM blocks again. Lastly, participants completed the IPIP40 and the MPMI-s questionnaires.
Statistical analyses & dependent variables
We used the software R, version 4.2.2 (R Core Team, 2022) for data
cleaning and analyses and followed the data cleaning protocol established in Experiment 1. Performance in the WM tasks was scored as the
proportion of correctly remembered items using partial credit scoring.
For this purpose, the accuracy in each trial was used and then task
performance was calculated as the mean value of these partial scores for
each task individually. As a measure of WM capacity, we calculated a
WM composite score by using the mean performance across all three
WM tasks. This results in a measure ranging from 0 to 100 with higher
values reflecting higher WM capacity. We also considered binding and
updating performance individually.
RTs and accuracy in the ongoing task and clock checking were
calculated as in Experiment 1. Instead of the preregistered linear mixed
models, we used Spearman’s rank correlation test to analyze the
strength and direction in the relationship between WM capacity and
ongoing task performance, strategic clock checking and clock checking
frequency. This decision was based on the non-normal distribution of
residuals in the LMM analysis. To analyze strategic slowing we used a
similar approach as in Experiment 1. A paired-sample t-test using only
blocks with successful PM performances was conducted. Within each
block, mean RTs in the ongoing task in S3 and S4 were compared.
Additionally, because of sufficient data with unsuccessful PM performance, we compared RTs observed in S4 between cases where PM
performance was successful and cases where it was unsuccessful. The
Wilcoxon signed-rank test was employed to address the remaining
imbalance between the numbers of successful and unsuccessful trials.
To analyze PM performance, we utilized GLMMS, to allow for interactions and account for the binary nature of PM performance with a
random intercept for participants, and the binary-coded PM performance (1 = successful intention fulfillment, 0 = unsuccessful intention
fulfillment) as dependent variable. Again, we found a general trend with
an improvement in PM performance throughout the experiment.
Consequently, we introduced block number as a detrending variable like
we did in Experiment 1. The same strategies as in Experiment 1 to
evaluate significance of model predictors and identify the model with
the best fit were used. To test which predictors are related to PM performance, we added the predictors WM composite score, the block-level
predictor strategic clock checking, the conscientiousness measure, selfreported PM abilities and, in addition to the preregistered analyses,
log RTs in S4 in a stepwise fashion to our model. Like in Experiment 1,
we evaluated model fit based on McFadden’s pseudo R2pseudo.

Procedure
The study was advertised as a WM study without giving details about
the PM task beforehand to avoid a primary focus on the PM task. Participants first performed the WM tasks explained above in the order in
which they were described. Next, participants performed the ongoing
task with the embedded PM task which was very similar to the difficult
condition in Experiment 1 with a few changes. In contrast to Experiment
1, the picture corresponding to the previously shown word remained
visible for three seconds rather than indefinitely. This adjustment was
made to prevent participants from taking breaks during the ongoing
task. Trials in which participants did not respond within the three second time window were considered as incorrect. To increase motivation,
participants could earn an extra 2 € if their accuracy in the ongoing task
exceeded 75 %. This time, instead of the Enter key, we used the “a” key
as the PM response key after the 5-minute intervals, to reduce the
prominence of the PM task. The retrospective component in the PM task
to enter a target word was no longer included as the analyses in
Experiment 1 did not reveal a difference between remembering the
intended action and executing it correctly. Instead, we assessed PM
performance, as commonly done in the Einstein-McDaniel paradigm, by

Results & discussion
Descriptive statistics for ongoing task performance, clock checking,
PM performance, the WM measures, and non-cognitive measures are
displayed in Table 3.
WM composite score and ongoing task accuracy showed a significant
moderate positive correlation, rs(130) = .54, p < .001. These results
suggest that participants with higher WM capacity perform more accurately in the ongoing task. Conversely, WM composite scores and RTs in
the ongoing task were not correlated, rs(130) = -.18, p = .983, indicating
that WM capacity was not associated with the speed of ongoing task
performance. Furthermore, we found a significant positive correlation
between WM composite score and both strategic clock checking, rs(130)
= .19, p = .016, and absolute clock checking rs(130) = .19, p = .016.
These results suggest that participants with higher WM capacity tend to

Table 4.
The paired t-test to analyze slowing from S3 to S4 for successful PM
blocks revealed no significant slowing effects, t(872) = -1.89, p = .058.
Thus, while these results suggest a potential trend towards slower RTs in
S4 compared to S3, these effects were not statistically significant in this
sample. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed a significant difference
between RTs in S4 when PM fulfillment was successful, M = 833.49, SD
= 200.31, compared to when it was forgotten, M = 800.53, SD = 182.60,
p < .001 (Fig. 5). These findings indicate that RTs in segment S4 varied
significantly between cases where PM performance was successful and
those where it was unsuccessful, suggesting that people tended to slow
down when approaching the time of intention execution.
In a next step, we used GLMMs to analyze the dependent variable PM
performance. Our baseline model included the random intercept for
participant and the detrending factor of block number. First, we specified a WM composite model and found a significant effect for WM
composite score, b = 4.836, SE = 1.553, z = 3.114, p = .002. The
comparison to the baseline model showed a significant difference in
model fit in favor of our WM composite model, χ2(1) = 9.576, p = .002,
R2pseudo = .04. These results suggest that PM performance is associated
with the WM composite score. However, the specific component
responsible for this association remains unknown. In the subsequent
model, we replaced the WM composite score with the updating and
binding scores as individual predictors. We found a significant effect of
the updating component, b = 3.716, SE = 1.094, z = 3.395, p < .001,
while the binding component was not significant, b = -1.546, SE =
2.307, z = -0.670, p = .503. The model comparison between the WM
composite model and the individual WM components model showed a

significant difference in model fit in favor of the individual WM components model, χ2(1) = 4.030, p = .045, R2pseudo = .04. These findings
suggest that the updating component has a positive relationship with PM
performance whereas the binding component has not. This pattern is in
line with findings in previous studies highlighting the importance of
updating abilities in PM (Kliegel et al., 2002; Mäntylä et al., 2007; Mioni
& Stablum, 2014; Voigt et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2011; Zuber & Kliegel,

was higher than that of the binding measure (.94 vs .79). To address this
difference, we applied an attenuation correction to the correlation of all
three WM measures to estimate the correlation with PM performance
assuming perfect reliability of the former measures. The corrected correlations increased from .26 to .30 for updating capacity, from .08 to.10
for binding capacity, and from .19 to.23 for operation span. Since the
rank order of the correlations remained unchanged, we conclude that
the differences in predicting PM performance between updating and
binding are unlikely to be solely due to differences in reliability but
nevertheless these differences should be taken into account when
interpreting the present results.
In a block-level predictor model we added strategic clock checking
and log RTs in S4 to our previous model. There was a significant effect of
strategic clock checking,1 b = 2.112, SE = 0.168, z = 12.560, p < .001,
whereas RTs in S4 did not predict PM performance, b = 1.072, SE =
0.637, z = 1.683, p = .092. We found a significant increase in model fit
compared to the individual WM components model, χ2(2) = 246.98, p <
.001, R2pseudo = .34. Also, the overall model fit substantially improved.
This replicates the clock checking results of Experiment 1, highlighting
the importance of strategic clock checking as a predictor for PM performance. Even though we found significantly slower RTs in S4 if the PM
task was remembered in the Wilcoxon signed-rank test reported above,
it remains unclear whether these effects are functionally related to PM,
as they are not a significant predictor of PM performance. Possibly, they
are related to clock checking behavior which tends to increase towards
the end of a block. In a final step, we introduced conscientiousness and
self-reported PM ability as additional predictors to the previous model.
Neither conscientiousness, b = -0.079, SE = 0.255, z = -0.311, p = .756,
nor self-reported PM abilities, b = -0.009, SE = 0.257, z = -0.034, p =
.973, were significant predictors. Model comparison revealed no significant improvement in model fit, χ2(2) = 0.130, p = .937, R2pseudo =
.34, thus confirming the block level predictor model as our final model
(Table 5). This is contradictory to previous research that suggests an
association between conscientiousness and time-based and event-based
PM (Arana et al., 2008; Cuttler & Graf, 2007; Smith et al., 2011). We did
not find a significant effect of self-reported PM ability on PM.

correlational nature of Experiment 2, it is unclear whether updating
abilities are a prerequisite for time-based PM performance. For this
reason, we ran a third experiment in which we experimentally manipulated updating demands in the ongoing task and tested the effect on PM
performance. Similar to Experiment 1, we manipulated the WM load
imposed by the ongoing task between participants, to test whether PM
performance would suffer from an increased load. We created two
different WM load groups, one updating-specific load group and a
capacity-load group in addition to a control group. In Experiment 2, we
did not observe a correlation between conscientiousness and PM performance. Nevertheless, previous studies report correlations between
Big Five factors and PM performance (Uttl et al., 2013). We thus again
assessed Big Five personality traits, this time conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism to test whether any of these factors would
additionally explain variance in PM performance outcomes.

Experiment 3

Tasks
The experimental tasks were programmed and run with PsychoPy
2022.2.5 (Peirce, 2007). Personality data was collected after the PM
experiment using SoSci Survey (Leiner, 2023).
Ongoing Task. Participants completed the word-picture matching
task as ongoing task, asking them to determine whether a presented
picture matched a word cued by a red cross. This task featured eight
different locations on which words were presented and the presentation
pattern varied between the experimental groups (Fig. 6b). Trial duration
was extended in this experiment, because, on each trial, participants
were presented with two sets of stimuli instead of one. In the updating
group, participants saw an initial set of five words at randomly chosen
positions for 4000 ms. These words were followed by a second set of
three words which were presented at the same positions as three of the
previously presented words for 2400 ms. Participants were asked to
update the three words from the first set with the words from the second
that were presented at the same positions. So, for the final test participants had to memorize a total of five words, two from the initial set and
three from the updating set, while removing three outdated words
(Fig. 6a, G1).
In the load group, participants were also presented with a first set of
five words at five different locations and then with a second set of three
words at new locations. Participants had to remember all eight words.
For both the updating and load groups, half of the pictures matched the
word (50 % first set, 50 % second set), 25 % of them did not match but
showed another word presented in the trial (50 % first set, 50 % second
set) and 25 % of them matched a word that was not presented in the
current trial (Fig. 6a, G2). Participants in the control group were presented with an initial set of five words in five random locations. The

Method
Participants
A new sample of 155 young adults participated in this study, either
for course credit or monetary compensation. Seven participants were
excluded either due to scoring below chance in the ongoing task,
because they were unable to follow instructions, or discontinuing their
participation prematurely. This resulted in a sample of 148 participants
(18 – 33 years, Mage = 22.7, SD = 3.11; 77 % female). Sample size was
planned based on the recommendations for sufficient sample sizes for
multilevel modeling provided by Maas and Hox (2005), indicating that a
sample size of 50 participants per group can yield accurate estimates of
regression coefficients and variance components. Additionally, the decision was informed by the simulation studies conducted by Paccagnella
(2011).
In a between-subject design with three groups we manipulated the
level of updating resources demanded by the ongoing task (N = 49), the
WM capacity load imposed by the ongoing task (N = 52) and added a
control group (N = 47). Participants were randomly assigned to one of
the groups.

The results of Experiment 2 suggest that WM capacity, and specifically updating abilities, are positively correlated with PM performance,
as are variations in clock checking strategicness. However, given the

second set featured three to be ignored (“XXXX”) stimuli. These were
either presented in locations of the previous words (conceptually
matching the updating group) or in the locations that were not used in
the initial set (conceptually matching the load group). Half of the pictures matched the word, 25 % did not match but showed a picture
corresponding to another word in that set and 25 % matched a word that
was not presented in the current trial (Fig. 6a, G3).
Personality assessment. To measure conscientiousness, agreeableness and neuroticism, we used the respective items of the German
version of the IPIP40. This is an open access measure that has high
convergent validities with the German version of the NEO-FFI (Hartig
et al., 2003).

three words from the initial set were instructed to be replaced and
forgotten. There is strong evidence that item replacement is highly
effective in WM, meaning that they can be replaced often in a way the
first presented words are fully removed from WM. The updating group
should therefore be confronted with less capacity load (Dames &
Oberauer, 2022). Whenever there was an overall effect of group, we
followed up with a contrast analysis first testing for an updating specific
effect by comparing the updating and the control groups, Ψupdating =
(− 0.5, 0, 0.5), and for a capacity load effect by comparing the updating
and control condition against the load condition Ψload = (0.5, − 1, 0.5).
To analyze strategic slowing, we implemented the same analysis as in
Experiment 1, comparing mean RTs in the ongoing task in S3 and S4
with a 3 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA.
Again, GLMMs were utilized, to account for the binary nature of PM
performance with a random intercept for participants, and the binarycoded PM performance (1 = successful intention fulfillment, 0 = unsuccessful intention fulfillment) as dependent variable. Again, we found
general trend with an improvement in PM performance with time-ontask and thus a centered block variable was introduced as a detrending variable (see Experiment 1). To assess group effects on PM performance, we applied the same contrasts as for the ongoing tasks
analyses—namely, Ψupdating = (− 0.5, 0, 0.5) for an updating specific
effect and Ψload = (0.5, − 1, 0.5) for a capacity load effect. To test which
predictors are related to PM performance, we added the predictors
contrasts for group effects, the block-level predictor strategic clock
checking and the personality traits in a stepwise fashion. RTs in blocks
with unsuccessful PM performances were not analyzed because of high
PM performances in the capacity load and control groups, therefore
leaving too little data to meaningfully compare the RTs in unsuccessful
blocks. Measures to evaluate significance of the predictors, model fit and
explained variance were used like in Experiment 1.

Procedure
The study was advertised as a WM study without giving details about
the PM task beforehand to avoid a primary focus on the PM task. The
ongoing task and the PM task were introduced as being equally important. Participants who already participated in Experiment 2 were not
allowed to participate in this study. Participants had to perform the
ongoing task for which we applied the changes described above. The PM
task was embedded in this ongoing task, resulting in a 5-minute baseline
block and 8 consecutive PM blocks. Duration and structure of the PM
task remained the same as in the previous experiment. Participants were
to press the “a” key every five minutes (i.e., at the end of each block).
Statistical analyses & dependent variables
We used the software R, version 4.2.2 (R Core Team, 2022) for data
cleaning and analyses and, once more, followed the data cleaning protocol established in Experiments 1 and 2. For the analysis of strategic
clock checking we used the same measure as in Experiment 1 and 2. In
addition to preregistered analyses, we used ANOVAs to compare
ongoing task performance, strategic and absolute clock checking with
group as between-subjects factor, similar to the approach adopted for
Experiment 1. Both the updating and the load capacity groups were
presented with eight words in total. In the updating group, however,

ongoing task, clock checking strategicness, clock checking frequencies,
and frequencies of correct responses in the PM task, are displayed in
Table 6. We found a significant effect of group on ongoing task accuracy,
F(2, 145) = 12.24, p < .001, η2 = .14. Contrast analyses showed that the
accuracy in the groups with increased WM demands (updating and load
condition) was lower than in the control group but that the other two
experimental groups did not differ. We found a group effect on ongoing
task RTs, F(2, 145) = 4.68, p = .01, η2 = .06, which was due to a
particularly fast responding in the updating group which was unexpected. Clock checking strategicness differed significantly between
groups, F(2, 145) = 6.84, p = .001, η2 = .09. Contrast analyses suggested
that the updating group showed less strategic clock checking, t(145) =
3.69, p < .001. Absolute clock checking frequency did not differ
significantly between groups, F(2, 145) = 0.43, p = .65.
When analyzing slowing in the ongoing task, we found a significant
effect for group, F(2, 143) = 3.57, p = .030, η2G = .05, indicating that
there were differences in RTs in S3 and S4 among the three groups.
Similarly, a significant effect of segment was found, F(1, 143) = 8.12, p
= .005, η2G = .003. These results suggest that there were differences in
RTs between segment S3 and segment S4 which is immediately prior the
PM intention fulfillment. The interaction between group and segment
was not significant, F(2, 143) = 0.96, p = .383, suggesting that the effect
of segment on RTs did not vary significantly between groups (Fig. 7). In
sum, there was some evidence that participants slowed down strategically when time comes closer to fulfill the PM task but not differently so
in the three experimental groups.
In a next step, we implemented GLMMs to analyze the dependent
variable PM performance. The baseline model included a random
intercept for participant and the detrending factor of block number. For
the following models, we added the predictors group, strategic clock
checking and the personality traits in a stepwise fashion. First, we
specified an experimental effects model with the factor group and found
a significant effect for the updating group, b = 0.677, SE = 0.253, z =
2.680, p = .007, but not for the load group, b = -0.249, SE = 0.425, z =
-0.586, p = .558. The comparison to the baseline model showed a significant difference in model fit in favor of our experimental effects
model, χ2(2) = 7.83, p = .020, R2pseudo = .03. These results indicate that
our manipulation of updating demands negatively affected PM performance, while the load manipulation did not affect PM performance as
compared to the control group. However, the low model fit also indicates that a large proportion of the variance in PM remains unexplained. Second, we included the additional block-level predictor of
strategic clock checking. The effect of group was no longer significant, b
= 0.262, SE = 0.192, z = 1.365, p = .172, while strategic clock checking
had a significant effect, b = 1.961, SE = 0.162, z = 12.109, p < .001. We
compared this model to the experimental effects model and found a
significant difference in model fit in favor of the block-level predictor
model, χ2(1) = 205.88, p < .001, R2pseudo = .31. These results suggest that
strategic clock checking plays a crucial role for PM performance. Also,
the overall model fit substantially improved. Finally, we introduced the
personality traits as predictors to the model and found no significant
effect for conscientiousness, b = 0.167, SE = 0.223, z = 0.750, p = .454,
neuroticism, b = 0.162, SE = 0.223, z = 0.729, p = .466, or agreeableness, b = -0.018, SE = 0.295, z = -0.061, p = .952. The chi-square test

showed no significant difference improvement in model fit, χ2(3) =
0.945, p = .815, R2pseudo = .31, confirming the block-level predictor
model as the final model (Table 7).
The most variance in PM was explained by the clock checking model
and in this model the group factor was longer significant. This result
suggests, that as participants encounter increasingly demanding
ongoing tasks, they seem to become less strategic in their clock checking
behavior (although the absolute clock checking remains comparable
with the other conditions). Thus, general cognitive ability and taskspecific abilities are not independent of each other, despite the fact
that they both contribute uniquely to overall PM performance as results
of Experiment 2 suggested.

General discussion

Employing a segmentation method similar to Joly-Burra et al. (2022),
we divided each block into four segments, which may not fully capture
the slopes of RT patterns. Understanding how time-based PM tasks influence ongoing task performance is crucial, as these tasks reflect the
activities we routinely undertake, such as completing work assignments
while awaiting meetings (Kvavilashvili & Fisher, 2007). Insights into
this relationship can enhance our comprehension of cognitive processes
in real-world contexts, shedding light on how maintaining an intention
influences our current engagements.
While our studies provide valuable new insights into the factors
influencing time-based PM performance, several limitations should be
noted. One limitation is the generally relatively high PM performance
observed across all three experiments. This fact may have limited the
variability in PM performance and thus prevented the detection of subtle
effects or individual differences that could have been revealed with a
broader range of performance levels. Future research could benefit from
recruiting participants with a wider range of PM abilities to better
capture individual differences and their underlying mechanisms.
Moreover, while our laboratory-based experiments shed light on the
cognitive processes involved in time-based PM tasks, applying these
findings to real-world settings may be challenging. The complexity and
variability of everyday tasks may not fully align with the controlled
conditions of laboratory experiments. Thus, future studies should
explore PM performance in naturalistic settings to enhance ecological
validity and better understand the practical implications of our findings
(Rummel et al., 2023). Regarding generalizability of the present findings
it is worth noting that age represents another significant factor
contributing to variations in PM performance (Ball et al., 2019; Gonneaud et al., 2011), which was not covered in the current studies. Previous research has highlighted age-related declines in PM performance
across both event-based (Kliegel et al., 2008) and time-based PM tasks,
where these declines are often accompanied by a deficient use of strategic clock checking to monitor the time until PM intention fulfillment
(Mäntylä et al., 2009; Vanneste et al., 2016). Similarly, age-related declines in WM performance have been well-documented (Salthouse,
1994; Salthouse et al., 1991), indicating a potential association between
age-related changes in task-general WM and task-specific time monitoring processes (Gonneaud et al., 2011). Future research should test
whether age-related declines PM performance depend on a deficit in
general cognitive abilities or task specific abilities in PM. Furthermore,
while the experiments reported here provide a more detailed analysis of
the role of WM processes, particularly the updating component, they
don’t examine how other executive functions contribute to time-based
PM performance. Future research should explore how different aspects
of executive processes, such as distractor inhibition and dominant
response inhibition, affect time-based PM and task specific abilities like
clock checking. It would also be valuable to investigate whether the role
of these executive functions differs between time-based and event-based
PM tasks. Such research could provide a more detailed understanding of
how various executive processes contribute to PM performance. Especially whether specific executive functions are differentially involved
depending on the type of PM task.
Finally, present research contributes to our understanding of timebased PM by highlighting the role of top-down cognitive processes,
particularly updating, in monitoring and executing future intentions.
While previous studies have primarily focused on event-based PM, our
findings demonstrate that time-based PM tasks place substantial demands on cognitive functions, such as time-monitoring strategies. Our
studies extend the theoretical understanding of time-based PM by
showing that successful PM performance is not merely a function of taskspecific strategies but also relies on the availability of general cognitive
resources, such as WM processes. In particular, under conditions of high
cognitive load, the strategic time monitoring behavior becomes more
critical for successful PM performance. Consequently, this finding underscores the need to understand PM as a dynamic process that combines general cognitive abilities with task-specific abilities in future

Ensuring timely execution of intended actions is essential for
everyday life. We conducted three studies to better understand the
contributions of general cognitive abilities (WM) and task specific
abilities (time monitoring) to successful time-based PM and the interplay of these processes. In our first experiment, we manipulated WM
capacity load within the ongoing task. Results revealed a significant
decrease in PM performance with increased WM demands in the ongoing
task and further showed that strategic clock checking plays a role for
time-based PM. The interaction between the load manipulation and
strategic clock checking indicated that clock checking disproportionally
decreases when WM load increases. In Experiment 2, we took an individual differences approach, measuring WM capacity through the processes of updating and binding and participants engaged in the high
capacity load PM task from Experiment 1. We observed a significant
association between WM capacity, particularly updating capacity, and
PM performance and found a substantial part of the variance in PM
performance to be explained by strategic clock checking. Importantly,
WM updating remained a significant predictor of PM, in addition to
strategic clock checking. Experiment 3, again, employed an experimental approach, manipulating updating resources and capacity load in
the ongoing task. Although an effect of the updating load was evident, it
vanished when group differences in strategic clock checking were
additionally considered. Notably, no personality trait or self-reported
PM ability showed association with PM performance across all experiments. Our findings consistently underscored time monitoring in terms
of strategic clock checking as the most powerful predictor of time-based
PM performance.
Taken together, these findings suggest that general cognitive abilities
(WM) and task-specific abilities (time monitoring) are not completely
independent of each other. When the demands on the general cognitive
abilities are particularly high in an ongoing task, the task specific strategies will also suffer. Nevertheless, individual differences in WM
(updating or binding) abilities do not fully explain individual differences
in task specific time monitoring abilities and their contribution to timebased PM performance. Future research is certainly necessary to better
understand the complex interplay between task general and task specific
time-based PM processes.
A couple of additional findings are worth discussing. In Experiment
1, we observed a significant effect of increased capacity load in the
ongoing task on PM performance, which nevertheless disappeared once
we allowed an interaction between these predictors. Surprisingly, in
Experiment 3, we did not find a WM capacity load effect on PM performance. One reason might be that the control group in Experiment 3
was presented with five words (one more than the medium load condition in Experiment 1) but for a longer interval (1200 ms in Experiment
1 vs. 4000 ms in Experiment 3) and was required to maintain them for a
longer duration (100 ms in Experiment 1 vs. 2600 ms in Experiment 3).
Consequently, the WM demands may have substantially differed between the two experiments, making it possible to compensate task
complexity with rehearsal strategies.
Previous research has demonstrated that implementing a delay
strategy by slowing RTs in the ongoing task can enhance event-based PM
performance (Heathcote et al., 2015). In our study, we sought to explore
whether similar slowing effects occur in the ongoing task during a timebased PM task and whether they relate to PM performance. Our findings
revealed a significant increase in RTs during the last quarter of each
block compared to the previous one in Experiments 1 and 3, although
this trend was absent in Experiment 2. However, in Experiment 2, a
significant difference in RTs emerged between the last segment before
successful completion of the PM task and the segment after which the
PM task was forgotten. Surprisingly, this observed slowing effect was not
a significant predictor of PM performance. It is conceivable that the
detected slowing effects are not crucial for successful PM performance,
or perhaps our measurement methodology was not well chosen.

Conclusions
In summary, our research highlights the role of general cognitive
abilities, particularly WM, in predicting time-based PM performance.
Our results show that individuals are more likely to forget their PM
intentions when WM resources, more specifically updating resources,
are impacted by ongoing task demands. Strategic clock checking proofed
to always be a powerful task specific predictor of PM performance which
does not seem to be completely independent of general cognitive PM
processes. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the
cognitive mechanisms underlying time-based PM and highlight the
importance of considering WM capacity in the context of PM tasks.
