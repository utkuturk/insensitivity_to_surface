Introduction
Acquiring new words is an important part of developing language
skills (Gaskell & Ellis, 2009). Linking new words to objects is chal­
lenging as each word could refer to any number of objects, actions, or
ideas (McMurray et al., 2012; Quine, 1960). Yet, in ambiguous contexts
containing both novel and familiar objects, toddlers easily and quickly
link a novel word to a novel referent (Halberda, 2003; Mervis & Ber­
trand, 1994). One explanation for this ability, referred to as fast map­
ping (Carey & Bartlett, 1978) or referent selection (e.g., Horst &
Samuelson, 2008), is that toddlers rely on a mutual exclusivity
assumption — that each object has only one name (e.g., Waxman &
Booth, 2000), an assumption similar to lexical contrast (Clark, 1990),
and the novel noun nameless category principles (Golinkoff et al., 1992;
Merriman et al., 1995). These assumptions help to describe children’s
choices in ambiguous word learning contexts, but do not sufficiently
explain the underlying mechanisms (Mather, 2013). One explanation is
that children engage in a process-of-elimination during referent

selection, ruling out familiar competitors to map novel words to novel
objects (Axelsson et al., 2012; Halberda, 2003; Repnik et al., 2021;
Spiegel & Halberda, 2011). Another is that children choose a novel
target due to its novelty (e.g., Holland et al., 2018; Mather, 2013). More
evidence on children’s attention and encoding during referent selection
is needed to disentangle whether referent selection is best explained as a
process-of-elimination or a novelty bias. We also question whether this
changes across repeated exposures and under conditions where children
receive reinforcement for their selections. There are also mixed findings
regarding the degree of attention to novel objects during referent se­
lection and how much this supports retention (e.g., Bion et al., 2013;
Booth et al., 2008; Kucker et al., 2020).
Encoding during referent selection and later retention
Measuring eye movements during referent selection can provide
access to children’s real-time interpretations of words and allow us to
make assumptions about children’s decision making (Fernald et al.,

novel word will help us differentiate between these two accounts.
Halberda (2006) is consistent with the process-of-elimination ac­
count. In that study, when both adults and 3-year-old children were
fixating on a target at the onset of a word (e.g., blick in “Look at the
blick”), they shifted their gaze back-and-forth between targets and
competitors on a greater proportion of novel target trials than familiar
target trials. This looking pattern even occurred when the participants
had already seen both the target and competitor prior to noun onset, that
is, when it should be unnecessary to check on the competitor object.
Shifting their gaze between the target and competitors at the onset of the
word also led to the children and adults taking longer to point in the
novel than in the familiar trials. Thus, Halberda (2006) argued, based on
these converging pieces of evidence, that lexical knowledge and
assessment of competitors is an important step during referent selection.
Other studies have found better referent selection accuracy among
toddlers who could spontaneously name competitor objects rather than
only comprehend their labels, suggesting that lexical knowledge of
competitors improved toddlers’ capacity to rule them out (Grassmann
et al., 2015; but see Kucker et al., 2020). More recently, Hilton et al.
(2019) found greater than chance looking at familiar targets during
referent selection, but chance level looking at novel targets suggesting
more diffused attention across objects during novel target trials.
Mather (2013), who instead argued for a novelty bias, where chil­
dren link novel words with novel objects with little need to consider
familiar competitors, also notes a confound in referent selection studies,
specifically that novel targets are often both novel and nameless. Several
studies have explored this confound with children between 10 and 30
months of age. A study with 10-month-olds, who were yet to acquire
familiar competitor words, found that they looked longer at the novel
target than familiar competitor (particularly towards the later portion of
trials), suggesting that at lower levels of vocabulary size the preference
for novelty is based more on cognitive than language constraints (Kucker
et al., 2020; Mather & Plunkett, 2010). Similarly, Mather and Plunkett
(2012) found that, relative to previously seen novel objects, 22-monthold toddlers looked longer at a completely novel object when presented
with a novel word (e.g., “Look at the Gub!”). Toddlers in that study were
also faster to demonstrate a novelty preference in the context of familiar
competitors. In an object selection task, Horst et al. (2011) observed that
when all objects present are nameless (i.e., novel), toddlers will choose
the most novel object as a referent of a novel word relative to recently
familiarised novel objects (for a similar finding see also Holland et al.,
2018). In sum, there is a developmental effect that is linked with the
development of children’s lexicon such that with an increasing vocab­
ulary size, referent selection likely shifts from cognitive to more lin­
guistic constraints. The studies above demonstrate that toddlers also use
novelty to solve disambiguation trials, but neither study tested chil­
dren’s retention. Thus, it remains unclear whether a novelty bias during
disambiguation affects later retention.
Current Study. In the current paper we explore toddlers’ looking
behaviours during referent selection to disentangle whether children
solve referential disambiguation by using a process-of-elimination or
relying on a novelty bias. Our other key aim is to better understand
whether a focus on novelty supports later retention. We randomly
assigned children to either an ostensive naming or non-ostensive naming
condition to assess the effect of reinforcing children’s attention to target
objects following the initial encoding phase on immediate as well as
delayed retention. We tested 2.5-year-old children to extend the findings
of previous referent selection studies with novel targets (e.g., Bion et al.,
2013; Golinkoff et al., 1992; Heibeck & Markman, 1987; Horst, 2011).
Children completed two blocks of referent selection trials and we
measured children’s looking proportions to the target objects relative to
two competitors in each trial to determine if attention to targets changes
across trial blocks. For consistency with previous referent selection
studies that included overt behaviours (e.g., reaching toward, picking
up, and pointing to target objects), we also asked children to point to the
target objects (e.g., Halberda, 2006). Relative to familiar target trials, in

2008; Halberda, 2006). Children’s looking proportions to targets across
time can provide an indication of not only the focus on targets, but how
it changes relative to a focus on competitors. Better understanding of
what drives looking behaviours during the earliest stages of word
learning could also highlight whether a focus on targets supports later
retention.
Despite children’s effective ability to disambiguate novel words,
retention of multiple fast-mapped words is more difficult (Axelsson &
Horst, 2013; Horst & Samuelson, 2008). Endogenous factors, such as
attention to the target during the encoding stage could affect retention.
A key aspect of the encoding stage is attending to a novel object while
hearing a novel word (Wojcik, 2013), but it is uncertain if the degree of
attention during encoding supports retention. Bredemann and Vlach
(2021) argued that the speed and ease associated with referent selection
might involve reduced attention to novel targets and inhibit retention.
Relatedly, Bion et al. (2013) found that greater target looking pro­
portions was associated with better retention in toddlers (see also Hilton
et al., 2019; Twomey et al., 2018). However, Booth et al. (2008) found
that target attention did not predict better retention even when they
increased toddler attention through target manipulation (i.e., moving
targets during labelling; see also Kucker et al., 2020). Therefore, more
evidence is needed on the associations between target attention and
retention of novel words and what this relationship looks like over
longer time scales.
External factors during encoding can also affect retention. Axelsson
and Horst (2014) repeated referent selection trials presenting targets
with the same competitors, and Benitez and Smith (2012) presented
targets in the same locations across trials. Both studies found faster
target detection across trials and enhanced retention later. Repetition
likely added a degree of predictability (Benitez & Smith, 2012), and
ability to rule out competitors. Horst, Scott and Pollard (2010) also
found better retention among 2.5-year-old toddlers who encountered
fewer familiar competitors on referent selection trials. This is further
evidence that conditions supporting a better focus on novel targets
supports retention.
Feedback, such as repetition of the words, after the initial encoding
stage can also affect retention (e.g.,Gurteen et al., 2011; Storkel et al.,
2017). Ostensive naming is one form of feedback where the word is
repeated while directing children’s attention closely to the object and
making it visually distinct from competitor objects. For example, Horst
and Samuelson (2008) lifted and pointed to targets while naming them
after each referent selection trial, and found enhanced retention of novel
words among 2-year-olds (see also Axelsson et al., 2012; Vlach &
Sandhofer, 2012). However, without ostensive naming, simple repeti­
tion of the correct mapping did not facilitate retention (Axelsson et al.,
2012; Horst & Samuelson, 2008). More evidence is needed on the role of
ostensive naming along with target attention during referent selection
and how they relate to retention over longer time scales.
Differentiating between process-of-elimination and a novelty bias
Approaching referent selection from the perspective that children
use a process-of-elimination to disambiguate makes two assumptions:
first, that children know which referents are already associated with a
name and which are not (Halberda, 2003); and second, that children
attend to and rule out familiar competitors before selecting what they
think is the target referent (e.g., Halberda, 2006). In contrast, from a
novelty bias perspective, the novelty of the target drives children’s se­
lections (Mather & Plunkett, 2012). Therefore, according to the novelty
bias perspective, there is little need to attend to the familiar competitors
before making a selection. Mather (2013) argues that recognising each
familiar object before identifying a novel referent is cognitively
demanding and inefficient because the novelty of the target word and
the novelty of the referent object is sufficient without needing to
consider the nameability of the competitors. Thus, determining if and
how much children attend to the familiar competitors after hearing a

novel target trials, if children engage in a process-of-elimination, they
should spend more time looking at familiar competitors and conse­
quently their target looking proportions should be lower and they
should take longer to point to targets (see also Hilton et al., 2019). In
contrast, if children’s behaviour is driven by a novelty bias, they should
spend more time looking at novel targets relative to the familiar com­
petitors. However, this alone would be insufficient in supporting a
process-of-elimination account. We also assessed the time course of all
the children’s target looking to determine when they focus longer on
novel targets relative to familiar competitors. With these analyses, we
expected an initial focus on familiar competitors prior to an increase in
novel target looking in novel target trials. In the second block of trials,
we predicted faster target selections and higher target looking pro­
portions as the novel objects become more familiar – particularly for the
ostensive naming group who received feedback after each trial.
Few studies have considered the effect of attention to targets during
referent selection on retention over longer time scales. We assessed how
much children’s target looking proportions relative to familiar com­
petitors during referent selection relates to immediate retention, reten­
tion four hours later, and retention the following morning. As greater
target looking proportions are associated with better retention (Bion
et al., 2013; Wojcik, 2013), we hypothesised that this would support
both better immediate and longer-term retention, especially for children
who received ostensive naming (e.g., Axelsson et al., 2012) as it guides
children’s attention in early encoding.

Apparatus and materials
Stimuli. Fifty-eight images of familiar objects (e.g., tree, shoe) were
presented across warm-up and referent selection trials. These images
were sourced from the Bank of Standardised Stimuli (Brodeur et al.,
2014) and Shutterstock.com. The familiar words were chosen as they are
known by at least 50 % of Australian children according to the Austra­
lian English Developmental Inventory (OZI, Kalashnikova et al., 2016).
For the novel objects, four images of unknown objects and novel words
were sourced from the Novel Object and Unusual Name (NOUN) Data­
base (Horst & Hout, 2016). The novel words were all monosyllabic:
cheem, hux, kiv, and noop. The images were presented on a 24-inch Dell
monitor (1920 × 1080 resolution) and all images were on average of
77.11 mm × 65.99 mm (7.35◦ × 6.30◦ at a 60 cm distance). Interest
areas (IAs), not visible to children, were positioned around each image
for later extraction of fixation data. The IAs were all the same size, and
were sized to fit all objects (see Figs. 1 & 2).
A female native speaker of Australian English recorded auditory in­
structions with an AKG C4000 microphone. The audio files were edited
in Pro Tools 12 to ensure consistency in sound level, tempo, and
duration.
Eye tracking. Children’s fixations were recorded with an EyeLink
1000 system using a 16 mm lens and a sampling rate of 500 Hz and 0.5◦
spatial accuracy. A high contrast sticker placed above the child’s right
eye aided in gaze capture. Children sat on a caregiver’s lap 55–60 cm
from the camera and 60–65 cm from the display screen. The camera was
desktop-mounted in front of and beneath the display monitor using the
remote setting which allows for participant movement in an area of 22
cm × 18 cm × 20 cm. The images were presented using Experiment
Builder software (1.10.1630; SR Research). Eye tracking data was
extracted using Data Viewer software (4.2.1).

Method
Participants
A power analysis performed with G*Power (with 7 predictors, power
= 0.85, α = .05, effect size f2 = .25 based on Horst et al., 2020; Twomey
et al., 2014) revealed that 72 participants were needed (but see below
for power with extra predictors). The final sample included 72 typically
developing monolingual children (34 girls, 38 boys, M age = 30.28
months, SD = 1.32, range = 28.07 – 32.89 months) with 36 in the
ostensive naming group and 36 in the non-ostensive naming group.
Additional children were excluded from the analyses for difficulties with
the pointing task (ostensive n = 3; non-ostensive n = 7), fussiness/
inattentiveness (ostensive n = 2; non-ostensive n = 2), and eye tracking
issues (ostensive n = 2; non-ostensive n = 4). Two children in the nonostensive naming group did not point during the immediate retention
test and were excluded from the retention analyses aside from their gaze
data in the immediate retention test. Otherwise, all children completed
all the delayed test trials. All children had normal vision. Vocabulary
size did not differ significantly between children in the ostensive (M =
467.14, SD = 80.61) and non-ostensive groups (M = 469.23, SD =
76.23), t(69) = 0.11, p = .911, d = 0.03; as was also the case for gender,
Fisher’s Exact test, p = .238 (ostensive: 39 % female, non-ostensive: 56
% female); but they did differ in age, with the ostensive group older by
30.08 days, t(70) = 3.76, p < .001, d = 0.89 (ostensive: M = 30.82
months, SD = 1.43; non-ostensive: M = 29.74 months, SD = 0.96).
Therefore, we included age and an age-by-group interaction in the an­
alyses. Due to the addition of these two predictors our post-hoc power
was 0.80. The children’s mothers’ mean age was 35.19 years (SD = 5.28)
and they had 17.49 years in education (SD = 2.40); and fathers’ mean
age was 37.21 (SD = 7.88) with 16.57 years in education (SD = 3.22).
The ethnicity of the mothers was white Australian (92 %), white Euro­
pean (4 %), and Australian Asian (4 %). The ethnicity of the fathers was
white Australian (93 %), indigenous Australian (1 %), white European
(4 %), and South African (1 %). Participants were recruited via posts on
social media and flyers at childcare centres, cafés, and libraries. Data are
available on the Open Science Framework https://osf.io/6yvdw/.

Design and procedure
Ethical approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics
Committee at The Australian National University (Protocol Number
2015/078) and caregivers provided written consent.
Warm-up. Toddlers at 17 months (Mervis & Bertrand, 1994) and 2
years of age (Spiegel & Halberda, 2011) are capable of successful
referent selection via pointing, but we first provided three warm-up
trials with familiar objects (e.g., train, spoon, elephant) using A3 post­
ers on a wall to familiarise children with the pointing task. The exper­
imenter praised children’s correct choices or provided guidance for
incorrect choices.
Additional Warm-up. Once seated in front of the eye tracker, three

Block 1 and Block 2 to allow even time spacing across novel objects and
to avoid the same novel target appearing on consecutive trials. Pre­
senting the novel targets across two blocks enabled us to assess how
children’s fixations and looking times changed across blocks as the novel
targets became more familiar. Different familiar competitors were pre­
sented on each novel target trial to maintain children’s attention in the
task. This also increases variability and makes the task less predictable
(see Twomey et al., 2018 for a review on the usefulness of variability in
word learning). Whether children were asked to point to a familiar or
novel target alternated across trials, which also ensured that two novel
target trials did not occur sequentially. Target object locations (i.e., left,
middle, right) and novel target order (i.e., first, second, third, fourth)
were counterbalanced across children using four different presentation
orders.
For half of the children, each referent selection trial was followed
immediately by ostensive naming of the target. The target object moved
up the screen, bounced four times, and the object’s name was repeated
once, e.g., “Can you see the noop?” For children in the non-ostensive
naming group, there was no naming or movement.
For pointing accuracy, two experimenters stood behind the child and
recorded independently where the the child was pointing. A camera,
positioned behind the display monitor also recorded the child’s point­
ing, providing a frontal view, and was consulted for trials where the two
experimenters disagreed.
Immediate novel word retention. Immediately after the referent
selection trials, one new familiar target trial (sock) was presented to
familiarise children to the new stimuli layout with four objects per trial
(one object in each quadrant; see Fig. 2). Children were then presented
with the four novel word retention test trials. Presenting four objects in
each trial ensured that children saw each possible novel target on each
trial and an equal number of times. Object locations changed in each
trial. The same audio and novel word-order was used as in the referent
selection trials, but no feedback was provided in either condition. Par­
ticipants received a gift voucher (10AUD) and a book before leaving.
Medium- and long-delayed novel word retention. To test how
children’s looking behaviours related to their longer-term retention of
novel words, children were re-tested later the same day (medium delay)
and the following morning (long delay). These tests took place in chil­
dren’s homes using an iPad (4th generation) with a 9.7″ screen, pro­
grammed using Xcode 6. The average size of the objects was 51 mm ×
52 mm (10.82 × 11.03◦ at ~ 27 cm distance). Conducting the later tests
in children’s homes was aimed at reducing participant attrition.
An experimenter sat next to the child in a quiet room and held the
iPad in front of the child in easy reach. To familiarise children with the
touch-screen task, children first saw four warm-up trials (flower, bird,
clock, boat). Before proceeding to the retention test trials, we ensured
children could understand how to use the tablet. If they struggled to
complete the task (n = 17), we restarted the familiarisation trials. Ac­
curacy for the completed familiarisation trials was 99.31 % (i.e., one
child was wrong in two trials). Four novel word retention trials followed
and were presented only once. These were presented in the same order
as the immediate test trials with one exception. The instructions for
these trials asked children to touch the screen. (e.g., “Can you see the
noop? Touch the noop. Where is the noop?”). Again, no guidance was
provided. No ostensive naming was provided for either group. The same
procedure was used for the long-delayed retention trials the next
morning.

Fig. 2. Example retention trial with four novel objects (from top left to right:
hux, cheem, kiv, noop) and interest areas (not visible to participants).

additional warm-up trials with familiar objects (e.g., cup, star, pig) were
presented. These warm-up trials familiarised children with pointing to a
computer screen (for a similar task see Halberda, 2006; Spiegel & Hal­
berda, 2011). Before the start of each trial, an animated attention-getter
appeared to direct children’s attention to the centre of the screen. Ob­
jects appeared after children looked at the attention-getter for 300 ms.
Children saw three familiar objects displayed horizontally across the
display screen (see Fig. 1) and heard, “Can you see the__? Point to the__.
Where is the__?” The onset of the images and audio was identical and
there were no pauses between utterances. The recording played on a
loop until the child pointed, after which the experimenter ended the
trial. If the child did not point, the software ended the trial after 30 s
(2.5 % of all trials). The experimenters provided guidance if needed, or a
break if children failed to point in any of the three warm-up trials, and
the task was attempted once more (n = 6). In previous studies, children’s
referent selections were measured during shorter time frames (e.g.,
Halberda, 2006; Mather & Plunkett, 2009; Mather & Plunkett, 2012).
However, these studies presented only one competitor per trial and we
presented two competitors. Additionally, allowing a longer time frame
was aimed at determining how long children take to make a selection in
familiar and novel target trials. We presented one target and two com­
petitors in each trial to remain comparable to previous object-based and
eye tracking-based referent selection studies that typically present 3
objects (e.g., Axelsson et al., 2012; Hilton & Westermann, 2017; Horst &
Samuelson, 2008; Kucker et al., 2020).
Referent selection. Immediately after the eye tracking warm-up
trials, the referent selection trials began. These trials were identical to
the warm-up trials with two exceptions: children saw two familiar and
one novel object on each trial, and the experimenters did not provide
any guidance. Previous studies (e.g., Axelsson et al., 2018) revealed that
children were more comfortable with the eye tracker when they sat on
their caregiver’s lap. Caregivers were asked to help keep their children
still, and that we were interested in their child’s independent responses,
and that guidance or directing their child’s attention was unnecessary.
Children received two blocks of eight trials, for a total of 16 trials. Across
trials, children were asked to point to eight familiar target objects once
and four novel target objects twice (one in each block, for a total of eight
novel target trials). Presenting familiar target trials was aimed at
ensuring that children were listening to the instructions and not merely
choosing the most novel object present (see Holland et al., 2018; Horst
et al., 2011; Mather & Plunkett, 2009). Four novel objects were pre­
sented because children this age struggle to retain words beyond four in
this kind of task (e.g., Axelsson et al., 2012; Bion et al., 2013; Horst &
Samuelson, 2008). The novel targets were presented in the same order in

Referent Selection Accuracy Over the Entire Trial. First, referent
selection accuracy was assessed for the familiar and novel target trials by
calculating the proportion of trials where children correctly pointed to
the target (of 8 for each target type). These proportions were compared
4

Journal of Memory and Language 141 (2025) 104596

E.L. Axelsson et al.

to chance (0.33 due to the presence of 3 objects in each trial) using onesample t-tests to confirm whether children could successfully solve
disambiguation trials. We then compared pointing accuracy between the
target types (familiar and novel targets), the two trial blocks (first vs.
second), and the ostensive and non-ostensive groups using linear mixed
effects models (LMMs).
Second, children’s proportions of target looking over entire trials
were calculated to determine the amount of looking to a target relative
to all three objects in a given trial, target/(target + competitor 1 +
competitor 2). Proportions were averaged separately for the familiar and
novel target trials and were compared to chance (0.33) to assess referent
selection accuracy based on looking. These proportions of target looking
were also compared between the familiar and novel target trials, be­
tween the ostensive and non-ostensive groups, and across the first and
second trial blocks using LMMs. Higher target proportions indicate a
greater focus on the target and less on the competitors, and vice versa.
Target proportions at around 33 % would indicate a fairly equal spread
across a target and the competitors in a given trial and importantly,
would contribute to support for a process-of-elimination explanation
with children spending time fixating on competitors and not merely
focusing on the novel target.
Trial durations were determined by how long it took children to
point to a referent. Trial durations were therefore compared across the
familiar and novel target trials, between the ostensive and non-ostensive
groups, and across the first and second half of the referent selection trials
using LMMs.
The LMMs were performed using jamovi 2.2.5 software and the
GAMLj module 2.0.1 developed in R (Galluci, 2019) with the lme4
package (Bates et al., 2015). The aim here was to focus on the fixed
effects (with fixed intercepts) as we were largely interested in the
comparison between looking behaviours across familiar and novel target
trials, and the interactions with the ostensive and non-ostensive groups
and across trial blocks. Each analysis contained the random effect of
participant (with random intercepts) which was assessed using the loglikelihood ratio test. The default convergence optimiser (bobyqa) was
used to fit the models and parameters were estimated using maximum
likelihood due to the focus on the fixed effects. For the initial default
Type III ANOVA-style F-tests, the degrees of freedom were calculated
using the Satterthwaite method. Categorical predictors were sum-coded
(due to the inclusion of interactions) using simple contrasts, and
continuous predictors were centred (see OSF https://osf.io/6yvdw/ for
output files and code).
Fine-grained analyses. Cluster-based permutation analyses were
performed to determine when familiar and novel target looking pro­
portion ratios differed to chance across the first 3500 ms from noun
onsets in the referent selection trials. This more detailed assessment can
help determine when target looking proportions differ to chance and can
detect effects that otherwise could be missed when looking proportions
are calculated over an entire trial (see Borovsky et al., 2015). The eye
trackingR.com package (Dink & Ferguson, 2015) in R Studio 3.5.1.,
was used to convert the target looking samples to logit-adjusted looking
time proportion ratios (log(Prop to target/(1 – Prop to target))) and
these were segmented into 50 ms time bins (see also Borovsky et al.,
2015). Converting the raw proportions to logit-adjusted proportion ra­
tios allows the values to go beyond 0 and 1 which is necessary as the
confidence intervals for proportions near 0 and 1 can be reduced when
the values are bounded (see https://www.eyetracking-r.com/vignett
es/window_analysis and Barr, 2008). As proportions of 0 or 1 cannot
be log-transformed, the eyetrackingR package adds a very small value to
proportions of 0, and subtracts a small value from proportions of 1 (1/2
the smallest non-zero proportion, see eyetrackingR.com). We limited the
analyses to the first block to allow us to assess looking responses for the
first encounter with the novel targets. This is because subsequent en­
counters with novel objects can differ to initial encounters (Bredemann
& Vlach, 2021; Horst et al., 2011; Mather & Plunkett, 2012), and we
were interested in the time course of children’s focus on novel targets

when they are completely novel (but see Supplementary Materials for
analyses with the second trial block).
Retention Analyses. Target accuracy during the immediate, me­
dium-, and long-delayed retention tests were assessed by calculating
proportions of correct novel object selections (out of 4). These pro­
portions were compared to chance (0.25 due to the presence of four
objects in each trial) using one-sample t-tests to determine if children
had successfully retained the words. How much target attention during
referent selection predicts immediate, medium-, and long-delayed
retention was also assessed and compared between the ostensive and
non-ostensive groups using a LMM analysis.
Results
Referent selection accuracy over the entire trial
Referent Selection Pointing Accuracy Compared to Chance. The
distribution of scores for the familiar target trials was negatively skewed
as the scores were largely at ceiling. Wilcoxon’s one-sample signed rank
tests indicated that for the ostensive and non-ostensive groups, the
proportions of trials with correct familiar target pointing was greater
than chance (see Table 1). Pointing accuracy was also greater than
chance for the novel target trials.
Referent Selection Pointing Accuracy Comparisons. The following
variables were added as fixed effects into a linear mixed model: groups
(ostensive naming, non-ostensive naming), target types (familiar,
novel), trial blocks (first, second), and age and the following in­
teractions: group-by-target type, group-by-trial block, trial block-bytarget type, group-by-age, and group-by-trial block-by-target type. The
random effect of participant was significant, LRT(1) = 12.62, p < .001
(random intercept variance = 0.01 SD = 0.08), and the intra-class cor­
relation (ICC) was 0.19 suggesting small-to-moderate variability across
participants. All the fixed effects and interactions were non-significant
aside from target type, F(1,216) = 161.07, p < .001 (see also Table 2
for the fixed effects estimates and Fig. 3; see Table S1 in Supplementary
Materials for remaining F-tests). Pointing accuracy was significantly
greater for the familiar (M = 0.98, SE = 0.02) compared to the novel
targets (M = 0.74, SE = 0.02), which is expected as the familiar targets
were chosen to be words already known by children before the study and

the novel targets were used to ensure children did not know them at the
start of the study.
Referent Selection Proportions of Target Looking Compared to
Chance. For both the ostensive and non-ostensive groups, children’s
proportions of target looking in the novel and familiar target trials were
significantly greater than chance (0.33, see Table 1). Therefore, both
pointing accuracy and looking proportions to the targets indicated that
the children could successfully solve disambiguation trials. The rela­
tionship between pointing accuracy and target looking time proportions
was also assessed. Spearman’s correlations were used for the familiar
target trials due to the negatively skewed pointing scores. For the
familiar target trials, the relationship was non-significant for both the
ostensive ρ(30) = 0.23, p = .178, and the non-ostensive group ρ(30) =
.13, p = .448. For the novel target trials, there was a significant positive

correlation between pointing and target looking time proportions for
both the ostensive r(30) = .69, p < .001, and the non-ostensive group r
(30) = .46, p = .004. Thus, for novel target trials, proportions of target
looking related to their accuracy as indicated by proportions of pointing
accuracy. For the familiar target trials, children were at ceiling for
pointing accuracy, which could explain the weaker relationship with
looking proportions.
Referent Selection Proportions of Target Looking Comparisons. A
linear mixed model analysis was performed comparing the groups
(ostensive naming, non-ostensive naming), target types (familiar,
novel), and trial blocks (first, second) along with age, and the following
interactions: group-by-target type, group-by-trial block, group-by-age,
trial block-by-target type, and group-by-trial block by target type (see
Table 3 for fixed effects parameter estimates). The random effect of

participant was non-significant, LRT(1) = 0.65, p = .421 (random
intercept variance = 0.001 SD = 0.023), and the intra-class correlation
(ICC) was 0.04 suggesting minimal variability across participants. There
was a main effect of group, F(1,71.98) = 7.82, p = .007, with signifi­
cantly greater target looking time proportions in the ostensive (M =
0.49, SE = 0.01) compared to the non-ostensive group (M = 0.45, SE =
0.01). There was a main effect of target type, F(1,215.41) = 121.80, p <
.001, with greater target looking proportions in the familiar target trials
(M = 0.54, SE = 0.01) compared to the novel target trials (M = 0.40, SE
= 0.01). There was a main effect of trial block, F(1,215.41) = 13.67, p <
.001, with significantly larger target looking proportions in the first half
(M = 0.50, SE = 0.01) compared to the second half (M = 0.45, SE =
0.01). The main effect of age was non-significant, F(1,73.39) = 0.17, p =
.680, as was the group-by-age interaction, F(1,73.39) = 0.60, p = .440.
There were significant interactions between group and target type, F
(1,215.41) = 10.35, p = .001, trial block and target type, F(1,215.41) =
5.52, p = .020, as well as group, trial block, and target type, F(1,215.41)
= 5.26, p = .023, but the group-by-trial block interaction was nonsignificant, F(1,215.41) = 1.47, p = .226. Post-hoc Bonferroni-cor­
rected comparisons, revealed that these results are explained by greater
novel target looking proportions in the first trial block compared to the
second block for only the ostensive group (p = .014), but not the nonostensive group (p = .458). This suggests that ostensive naming led to
less focus on the novel targets before pointing by the second trial block.
For the familiar target trials, familiar target looking did not differ across
trial blocks for the ostensive naming group (p = .999), and the nonostensive group (p = .479) suggesting it remained high across trial
blocks. The difference between groups for familiar target looking was
non-significant in the first trial block (p = .999), but in the second trial
block, the ostensive naming group’s familiar target looking was signif­
icantly greater than the non-ostensive group’s (p < .001, see Fig. 4). The
difference between groups was non-significant for the novel targets for
both trial blocks (ps = .999). This suggests that ostensive naming led to
greater focus on targets for familiar targets.
In sum, compared to familiar target looking proportions, the novel
target looking proportions were lower indicating greater looking times
to the competitors and contributes to the suggestion that children were
completing a process-of-elimination. Compared to the first block of
novel target trials, by the second block, the focus became more evenly
spread across the three objects for the ostensive group and there was less
focus on novel targets before the selection (see Fig. 4). Interestingly, we
also found for the novel target trials in the first block, this corresponds to
an average of 6 fixations to the target and an average of 4 fixations to the
competitors, but by the second half, children fixated 4 times to the

targets and 4 times to the competitors. For the familiar target trials,
children fixated around 4 times to the target and twice to the competi­
tors in both blocks. Therefore, there were double the amount of fixations
to the competitors in novel target trials relative to familiar target trials.
Referent Selection Trial Durations. Differences in referent selection
trial durations were also compared between groups (ostensive naming,
non-ostensive naming), between target types (familiar, novel), and
across trial blocks (first, second) using a linear mixed model analysis
along with the addition of age and age-by-group (see Table 4). Trial
durations were positively skewed and were log-transformed which
improved the distribution, but original descriptive statistics are pre­
sented here and shown in Fig. 5 for ease of interpretation. The random
effect of participant was significant, LRT(1) = 81.97, p < .001 (random
intercept variance = 0.01 SD = 0.12), and the ICC was 0.50 suggesting
moderate variability across participants. The main effect of group was
non-significant, F(1,72) = 2.86, p = .095 (ostensive: M = 6263.32 ms, SE
= 341.76; non-ostensive: M = 5411.59 ms, SE = 370.15), but there was a
main effect of target type, F(1,214.60) = 119.95, p < .001, with
significantly longer trial durations for the novel target trials (M =
7175.15, SE = 280.12) compared to the familiar target trials (M =
4499.76, SE = 279.77). Trial durations were overall significantly longer
in the first trial block (M = 6323.62, SE = 279.77) than in the second
block (M = 5351.28, SE = 280.12), F(1,214.60) = 15.84, p < .001. The
main effect of age was significant, F(1,72.64) = 5.72, p = .019, but the
group-by-age interaction was non-significant, F(1,72.64) = 0.18, p =
.669. The relationship with age was negative (see Table 4), suggesting
that trials were shorter with increasing child age, but this relationship
did not differ between the ostensive and non-ostensive groups. There
were significant interactions between group and target type F(1,214.60)
= 6.57, p = .011, group and trial block F(1,214.60) = 6.16, p = .014,
trial block and target type F(1,214.60) = 51.40, p < .001, and group,
trial block, and target type F(1,214.60) = 9.91, p = .002 (see also
Table 4). Bonferroni-corrected comparisons revealed that these in­
teractions are explained by children in both groups taking longer in the
novel target trials than the familiar target trials in the first trial block
(ostensive: p < .001; non-ostensive p < .001). However, in the second
trial block, the difference in trial durations between the novel and
familiar target trials was non-significant for the ostensive naming group
(p = .999), but for the non-ostensive group, children were still taking
longer for the novel target than the familiar target trials (p < .001, see
Fig. 5). Therefore, ostensive naming likely helped children find the novel
targets when they encountered them again. Across trial blocks, differ­
ences in trial durations were non-significant for the non-ostensive group
for the familiar and novel target trials (ps > .05). For the ostensive

second trial compared to the first (p < .001), but trial durations did not
differ for the familiar targets (p = .389). Finally, the difference in trial

was significant in both trial blocks (ps > .05).

chance ratio score (− 0.301) across the time window, the eyetrackingR
package was used to conduct paired t-tests at each 50 ms time bin to find
any clusters of time bins with t-scores greater than 2 (as t-values greater
than 2 are significant at the .05 alpha level with this sample size, see
https://www.eyetracking-r.com/vignettes/divergence). Chance was
calculated based on the presence of 3 objects, the logit-adjusted pro­
portional looking time ratio at chance level (log(0.3333/(1-.3333))). To
allow for multiple tests, a cluster-based permutation analysis was per­
formed, which involved summing clusters of adjacent t-scores that are
greater than 2, and comparing them to a null hypothesis distribution of
cluster t-scores, by randomly permuting the clusters 2000 times. This
cluster-based permutations approach corrects for multiple comparisons
by limiting the family-wise error rate (see also Barr et al., 2014; Bor­
ovsky et al., 2015).
Ostensive group’s familiar target looking compared to chance. For
the familiar targets, logit-adjusted proportion ratios (log(Prop. to target/
(1 – Prop, to target))) were associated with a cluster of t-scores greater
than 2 between 500 and 1600 ms, and between 1700 and 1850 ms.
Following 2000 permutations of the summed t-scores, the cluster be­
tween 500 and 1600 ms was revealed as significantly greater than the
chance ratio score (− 0.301), t = 87.67, p < .001, but the cluster between
1700 and 1850 ms was non-significant, t = 7.02, p = .310 (see vertical
dashed lines in Fig. 6). Therefore, children looked at the familiar targets
at greater than chance levels from 867 ms (367 + 500 ms) after the noun
onset. Given the mean noun onset was 861.38 ms; (SD = 99.54 ms), this
suggests that toddlers looked significantly more at the familiar targets
from around 1728.38 ms from the presentation of the images.
Ostensive group’s novel target looking compared to chance. For the
novel targets, paired t-tests performed at each time bin revealed that
clusters of t-scores were less than 2 between 0 and 500 ms; between 600

Referent selection fine-grained analyses
To more closely investigate children’s looking behaviours during
referent selection, the time course of the target looking proportion ratios
during referent selection was assessed and compared to chance every 50
ms (see Borovsky et al., 2015). Data Viewer was used to extract chil­
dren’s looking samples to the familiar and novel targets during referent
selection from 367 ms after the target noun onsets to 3500 ms after the
noun onsets. The choice to start the time window at 367 ms after noun
onset is because young children take around 200 ms to initiate an eye
movement after the onset of an image; and fixations prior to 367 ms are
less likely to be based on auditory prompts (see Canfield et al., 1997;
Swingley, 2009; Swingley & Aslin, 2000). The mean noun onset time for
the target words was 861.38 ms (SD = 99.54 ms). Therefore, the start of
the analyses corresponds to 1228.38 ms after the trial start. Previous
investigations assessing fine-grained looking ratios tend to limit the time
windows to 2000 ms after the time window start (e.g., Borovsky et al.,
2015; Swingley, 2009; Swingley & Aslin, 2000), as longer time windows
involve more variable, less meaningful looking (Canfield et al., 1997;
Fernald et al., 2006). However, most of these studies typically presented
two objects. As children in the current study chose between three objects
and needed to point to the targets, the time window was extended to
3500 ms.

and 650 ms, and greater than 2 between 1200 and 1250 ms. These tscores were summed and following 2000 permutations of the time bins,
the cluster between 0 ms and 500 ms was revealed to be significantly less
than the chance ratio score (− 0.301), t = -34.73, p = .017 (see grey
shaded area in Fig. 6). The remaining clusters were non-significantly
different to chance (between 600 and 650 ms, t = -2.20, p = .515; be­
tween 1200 and 1250, t = 2.05, p = .594). Therefore, children focussed
significantly less on the novel targets relative to chance between 367 ms
(367 + 0 ms) and 867 ms from noun onset. Given the mean noun onset
was 861.38 ms; (SD = 99.54 ms), this suggests that toddlers looked
significantly less at the novel target from around 1228.38 ms from the
presentation of the images.
Non-ostensive group’s familiar target looking compared to chance.
The non-ostensive group’s logit-adjusted proportion ratios to the
familiar targets were associated with a cluster of t-scores greater than 2
between 1050 and 1450 ms and between 1500 and 2350 ms. Following
2000 permutations of the summed t-scores, both clusters were revealed
as significantly greater than the chance ratio score (between 1050 and
1450, t = 50.69, p = .035; between 1500 and 2350, t = 93.54, p = .020,
see vertical dashed and dot-dashed lines in Fig. 7). Therefore, children
looked at the familiar targets at greater than chance levels from 1417 ms
(367 + 1050 ms) after the noun onset. Given the mean noun onset was
861.38 ms; (SD = 99.54 ms), this suggests that toddlers looked signifi­
cantly more at the familiar targets from around 1911 ms from the pre­
sentation of the images.
Non-ostensive group’s novel target looking compared to chance. For
the novel targets, logit-adjusted proportion ratios were associated with
clusters of t-scores less than 2 between 0 and 1500 ms, and greater than 2
between 1900 and 2350 ms. Following 2000 permutations of the sum­
med t-scores, the cluster between 0 and 1500 ms was revealed as
significantly less than the chance ratio score (− 0.301), t = -157.88, p <
.001, and the cluster between 1900 and 2350 was non-significant, t =
22.74, p = .071 (see grey shaded area in Fig. 7). Therefore, children
looked at the novel targets at less than chance levels from 367 ms (367

+ 0 ms) after the noun onset. Given the mean noun onset was 861.38 ms;
(SD = 99.54 ms), this suggests that significantly less looking at the novel
targets occurs from 1228.38 ms after trial start.
Therefore, for both the ostensive and non-ostensive groups, children
looked at the novel targets less than chance initially and then propor­
tional looking times tended to be at chance. This is further evidence for
children having an initial focus on competitors and then dividing their
focus across both the target and the competitors (i.e., engaging in
process-of-elimination). In contrast, for the familiar target trials, there is
a clear focus on the targets relative to competitors.
Retention analyses
Immediate and Delayed Retention Compared to Chance: Target
Selection Accuracy. For immediate and medium-delayed retention,
both the ostensive and the non-ostensive group’s accuracy scores were
significantly greater than chance (.25), but by the long-delayed test,
only the ostensive group’s accuracy was greater than chance (see
Table 5).
Immediate Retention Compared to Chance: Target Looking Time
Proportions. The ostensive group’s target looking proportions were at
chance, and the non-ostensive group’s looking proportions were
significantly less than chance (0.25, see Table 5).
Proportions of Novel Target Looking During Referent Selection as a
Predictor of Immediate and Delayed Retention. The aim of our next
analysis was to determine how much children’s focus on the novel tar­
gets during referent selection was associated with immediate and
delayed retention. The following variables were added as fixed effects to
a linear mixed model: novel target looking proportions during referent
selection, group (ostensive naming, non-ostensive naming), retention
phase (immediate, medium-delayed, long-delayed, coded as a poly­
nomial variable), age, and the following interactions: group-byretention phase, retention phase-by-novel target looking, group-bynovel target looking, group-by-age, group-by-retention phase-by-novel

there was a significant interaction between retention phase and group, F
(2,137.35) = 7.91, p < .001. This was due to a significant difference
between the groups in the linear relationship across the retention phases
(β = 0.21, p < .001, see Table 6), which is explained by the ostensive
group’s retention increasing from immediate to long-delayed testing, and
the non-ostensive group’s retention decreasing from immediate to longdelayed testing (see also Table 5). Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc ana­
lyses revealed that retention did not differ significantly between the
groups for immediate, t(169.73) = 0.96, p = .999, or medium-delayed
retention, t(136.00) = -1.63, p = .999, but long-delayed retention was
significantly greater in the ostensive (M = 0.54, SE = 0.05) than in the
non-ostensive group (M = 0.31, SE = 0.05), t(170.62) = -3.17, p = .028.
There was also a significant effect of target looking proportions, F
(1,68.32) = 5.41, p = .023, with greater target looking during referent
selection predicting greater retention (β = .57, p = .023). The in­
teractions between target looking and group, F(1,68.32) = 0.02, p =
.896, and between target looking and retention phase, F(2,137.20) =
0.08, p = .922, were non-significant, but there was a significant inter­
action between target looking proportions, retention phase, and group, F
(1,68.32) = 5.41, p = .023. This is explained by a significant difference
between the groups in the linear relationship between target looking and
retention across the phases (β = -1.65, p = .002, see Table 6). For the
ostensive naming group, the greater the novel target looking during
referent selection, the higher the immediate retention (p = .009, see
Figs. 8 & 9). For the non-ostensive group, greater novel target looking
was associated with better long-delayed retention (p = .032). This sug­
gests that for the non-ostensive group, the benefits of greater target
looking proportions were apparent after around 24 h; whereas for the
ostensive group the benefits of greater target looking proportions were

pointing to novel targets (for similar findings see Halberda, 2006; Hilton
et al., 2019; Twomey et al., 2018). This is indicative of a process-ofelimination explanation of referent selection.
For the ostensive group, novel target looking proportions dropped
from the first to the second trial block, and children took less time to
point, suggesting that a single trial of referent selection of a given target
supported toddlers’ subsequent selection. However, the non-ostensive
group still took longer to point at novel targets compared to familiar
targets in the second block. Therefore, in the absence of additional
feedback provided by, in this case, ostensive naming, there was less
certainty compared to familiar targets in the second block when it came
to pointing to novel referents.

Discussion
Although learning and remembering word-object associations is a
long, gradual process (e.g., Gurteen et al., 2011; McMurray et al., 2012;
Storkel et al., 2017), toddlers easily solve initial disambiguation trials
when they encounter novel words and objects (e.g., Merriman et al.,
1995). It is unclear whether toddlers do so by using a process-ofelimination or relying on a novelty bias – or a bit of both. In the cur­
rent study, toddlers were highly capable of referential disambiguation as
reflected in their greater than chance pointing accuracy and looking
proportions to the novel and familiar targets. According to the more
fine-grained analyses, looking at the familiar targets was significantly
greater than chance soon after noun onset, but target looking was
significantly less than chance for the novel targets. Children also took
longer to point to novel targets than familiar targets. These converging
findings suggest that in novel target trials, children focus on and
consider the competitors first before increasing looking towards and

Implications for understanding referent selection
We hypothesised that if children engage in a process-of-elimination,
they should take longer to point at novel than familiar targets (see also
Halberda, 2006). This was expected not only due to uncertainty when
faced with a new name, but also due to time spent considering com­
petitors. We therefore expected overall novel target looking proportions
to be at chance level (33 %). In the current study, children did take
longer to point and children’s looking proportions to novel targets were

at 40 % in the first trial block and closer to chance in the second block.
Therefore, a focus on novelty is likely important during initial encoun­
ters, but the more fine-grained analyses indicated that children’s initial
focus is on familiar competitors before an increase in novel target
looking. If referent selection was based primarily on a novelty bias, then
children should have looked more at the novel targets relative to the
familiar competitors throughout the trials. However, in the current
study, children looked significantly less at novel targets for the first 1–2 s
after noun onset. Therefore, we have converging evidence that disam­
biguation of novel targets involves a process-of-elimination. One possi­
bility is that children looked less at the novel targets initially due to an
aversion to novelty, which has been found with shy children (e.g., Hilton
et al., 2019). Mather and Plunkett (2009) found that prior to the onset of
the target word, 19- to 22-month-old children look at familiar and novel
targets at chance levels. Our time course analyses, assess target looking
proportions after the initial prompt phrase and onset of the nouns, and
this is when toddlers look significantly less than chance at novel targets.
This is likely due to a preference for searching familiar competitors first,
in line with a process-of-elimination.
Halberda (2006) also assessed the proportion of trials in which 3year-old children looked at a competitor after hearing novel words
while looking at novel targets. We analysed novel target looking pro­
portions relative to competitors, and our results align with Halberda’s
(2006) findings that children look at competitors before an increase in
novel target looking. We also found children take longer to point to
novel targets compared to familiar targets – providing further support­
ing evidence for a process-of-elimination. Another difference between
studies is that we allowed children up to 30 s to point rather than the
shorter restricted time frames of previous studies (e.g., approx. 4 sec
following word onset, Halberda, 2006; Mather & Plunkett, 2012).
Therefore, the looking and pointing behaviours reported here reflect the
time children needed to select a referent. In familiar target trials chil­
dren took an average of 4.5 s, but in novel target trials children took 7 s
and engaged in double the amount of fixations to competitors.
By the second trial block, overall novel target looking proportions
dropped to chance. This decline is possibly due to less need to focus on
the novel target before initiating pointing, and because children were
still checking competitors in these trials. This finding contrasts with
Mather and Plunkett (2012) who found increasing novel target looking
proportions in subsequent trials. A difference with Mather and Plun­
kett’s (2012) study is that children were asked to find the referent a

finite number of times in each trial (1–6), but in the current study
children were asked multiple times as they continued to look until they
pointed. The repetition in the current study likely sped up pointing in the
second block (e.g., Benitez & Smith, 2012), but the novelty of the words
still involved a need to check competitors before pointing. The nonostensive group were still slower at pointing to novel than to familiar
targets in the second block, indicating that ostensive naming further
sped up subsequent referent selections (e.g., Benitez & Smith, 2012),
and possibly also increased children’s confidence in the testing context
(see Axelsson et al., 2022; Hilton & Westermann, 2017).
Children have an acute awareness of and bias towards novelty from
early in life (Fantz, 1964; Perone & Spencer, 2013). Mather (2013)
argued that as science favours parsimony, a simple and sufficient
explanation of children’s referent selections is a novelty bias. Despite the
differences between the methods in the current study and previous
studies (e.g., Halberda, 2006; Mather & Plunkett, 2012), the evidence
suggests that both a consideration of competitors and a bias to novelty
are important for successful referent selection. This is due to children’s
initial focus on competitors, and their greater overall novel target
looking relative to chance. The combined evidence of previous studies
(Halberda, 2006; Mather & Plunkett, 2012) and the current study sug­
gest that a reasonably simple definition of referent selection is an initial
consideration of familiar competitors and an attraction to novelty.
Retention
Based on pointing and touchscreen accuracy, both the ostensive and
non-ostensive groups retained the novel words at greater than chance
levels immediately after referent selection and four hours later, but the
following morning only the ostensive naming group’s retention was
greater than chance. For the non-ostensive group, retention dropped
significantly from immediate testing to the following morning, whereas
for the ostensive group, there was a significant increase from immediate
to afternoon testing that was sustained the following morning. There­
fore, there was a weakening in the strength of the word-object associa­
tions over time if children had not heard the objects ostensively named,
but for those who had, their memories for the words were maintained
over time.
Children’s retention looking times were only measured for immedi­
ate retention. Interestingly, the children in the non-ostensive group
looked significantly less to the target during immediate retention, and

disentangle whether the benefit of ostensive naming is due to the greater
attention to the object or the provision of the label.
Previous studies (e.g., (Kucker et al., 2018; Mather & Plunkett, 2010)
found that a preference for novelty predominates before children have
acquired the familiar competitors’ words (e.g., 10 months of age).
Children in the current study, however, were older (M = 30 months) and
had larger vocabularies (M = 468 words) and the familiar competitors
were chosen to be known words to children in this age range
(Kalashnikova et al., 2016). A preference for novelty is likely a driving
force for referent selection when there is less lexical knowledge to
support children’s choices and a process-of-elimination becomes more
important as children acquire words. Future studies should investigate
changes in looking behaviours during referent selection across age and
vocabulary size such as between 10 and 30 months to determine if a
novelty bias plays a larger role in referent selection at younger ages or
when children have smaller vocabularies. A longitudinal approach
following preverbal children could provide unique insight into the
developing mechanisms underlying referent selection and later reten­
tion. Interestingly, we found that children were faster to point with
increasing age, suggesting a faster ability to rule out competitors. To
further assess the role of vocabulary and/or familiarity, investigating
looking patterns during referent selection with novel and nameless ob­
jects with varying degrees of familiarity (e.g., Kucker et al., 2020;
Mather & Plunkett, 2012) would be useful to determine if children still
rely on a process of eliminating familiar objects (i.e., initial focus on
more familiar novel objects) or whether it is driven by a novelty bias (i.
e., a focus on the most novel object).
Future studies could also investigate the influence referent selection
has on children’s retention relative to other ways that words are pre­
sented to children such as explicit naming. If referent selection largely
involves engaging in a process of ruling out familiar competitors (e.g.,
Halberda, 2006), does this limit attention to novel targets during the
encoding stage? Bredemann and Vlach (2021) argued that the rapid
nature of referent selection likely involves less attention to targets
reducing long-term retention of word-object associations, which the
current study indicates. The number of competitors present during
referent selection can influence later novel word retention with one
competitor better than none (Zosh et al., 2013), but too many compet­
itors detrimental to retention (Horst et al., 2010). Therefore, at least one
competitor during referent selection might provide a necessary difficulty
that supports retention (Zosh et al., 2013). Comparing children’s looking
times to novel targets under different word learning conditions could
help tease apart the role of referent selection and attention to the target
on long-term retention. Future studies should also test the influence of
children’s attention during disambiguation on retention at even longer
delays (Bredemann & Vlach, 2021), and with a varied number of novel
words (Wojcik, 2021).
Finally, the findings here relate to children’s word learning under
controlled experimental conditions. As pointed out by Mather (2013), it
would be inefficient for children to rule out every familiar object in
ordinary ‘real-world’ environments where there is a large number of
objects present. Schroer and Yu (2023) investigated children’s attention
with head-mounted eye trackers during exploration of objects in a homelike setting while their caregivers named objects. The degree of visual
attention to the objects was not a sufficient predictor of retention, but
instead it was children’s manipulation of objects while attending to
them that predicted retention. Investigating children’s referent selec­
tions in a home-like environment with a head-mounted eye tracker
could provide better ecologically valid conclusions about whether
children engage in a process-of-elimination or rely on a novelty bias
when there are more objects available in more scattered locations.

the ostensive group’s focus on the target was at chance, but both groups
pointed at the targets at greater than chance levels. These findings are
perhaps a reflection of the switch from looking across 4 rather than 3
objects and all objects now being novel meaning they could no longer
rely on ruling out familiar objects to support their selections. These
factors likely added to the uncertainty and as the non-ostensive group
received no reinforcement of the word-object associations during the
referent selection phase, they likely experienced a greater level of un­
certainty. Future studies should investigate the focus on targets during
retention at longer time scales in relation to differing initial encoding
conditions.
We hypothesised that greater novel target looking during referent
selection would be associated with stronger retention, both immediately
after and longer-term (e.g., Bion et al., 2013; Hilton et al., 2019; Two­
mey et al., 2018), particularly for the ostensive naming group (e.g.,
Axelsson et al., 2012). We found greater novel target looking was
significantly associated with better retention for the ostensive group, but
only for immediate retention. For the non-ostensive naming group, there
was instead a significant relationship between novel target looking and
retention the following morning. A focus on the target objects during
referent selection is therefore, an important aspect of long-term acqui­
sition of words. All children were asked to identify referents of novel
words independently, but half the children were also explicitly told the
novel words that referred to the novel objects to reinforce encoding of
the link between the words and objects. Under these stronger encoding
conditions, any benefit of greater attention to the novel targets was seen
soon after, with little extra benefit later. We had speculated as to
whether the supportive effect of ostensive naming would be due to the
repetition of the words or due to focusing attention on novel targets.
Children in the non-ostensive naming group identified the referents and
arguably experienced weaker encoding conditions due to a lack of
feedback on their selections, but with sufficient focus on targets during
referent selection, their memories were more robust in the long term.
There are few studies that investigate children’s memory for novel
words following referent selection over longer time scales and there
have been calls for more research on this (e.g., Bredemann & Vlach,
2021). The current study provides important findings indicating that
under weaker encoding conditions, helping children sufficiently focus
on the word-object associations can support longer-term retention. A
greater focus on the targets likely leads to better initial trace memory
which has greater potential for strengthening over time such as during
wakefulness and sleep (see also Henderson et al., 2021). When initial
encoding conditions are strong, the current findings suggest that the
word-object associations can continue to be strengthened over time.
Limitations and future directions
One limitation with the current study is that the provision of osten­
sive naming likely meant that there were slight differences in the timing
of the progression of trials relative to the non-ostensive group. Without
ostensive naming, this group proceeded across referent selection trials
with shorter time gaps. We did not find any significant difference be­
tween the groups for the referent selection trial durations, but without
ostensive naming, the non-ostensive group’s referent selection phase
was shorter leading to a faster progression to the retention phase. The
time course analyses of the target looking proportions (see also Figs. 6
and 7) indicate that there are some differences between the groups. The
non-ostensive group focus on the familiar targets 500 ms later than the
ostensive group, but both groups focus on the novel targets at the same
time, but the non-ostensive group stay significantly below chance for
longer. This raises questions as to whether these slight differences are
due to greater uncertainty associated with not receiving ostensive
naming or due to differences in inter-trial-intervals. Future studies
should equate the timing between the groups for the inter-trial-intervals
with either a pause for the non-ostensive group or moving the target
object up without the provision of the object’s label. This will also help

Conclusions

dren’s referent selections including pointing and eye tracking data to

attempt to resolve the debate about whether children’s referent selec­
tion is driven by process-of-elimination or novelty bias. Converging
evidence indicated that children at this age are engaging in a process-ofelimination and likely ruling out familiar competitors before engaging in
a focus on novel targets. Additional findings indicate that more focus on
novel targets during referent selection was associated with better im­
mediate retention for the ostensive naming condition, but better delayed
retention for the non-ostensive group. Thus, referent selection is best
described as a process-of-elimination, and a focus on novelty may sup­
plement weaker encoding conditions such as when children do not
receive feedback on their selections. Overall then, we conclude, with the
current data, that at an age when children have acquired some familiar
words, both an initial focus on familiar competitors prior to a focus on
novelty are important to successful referent selection and a focus on
novelty is important for retention following referent selection.
