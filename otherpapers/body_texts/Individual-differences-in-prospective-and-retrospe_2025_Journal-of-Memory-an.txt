everyday life. Common examples of cognitive offloading include noting
upcoming appointments in a calendar and jotting down notes during an
important meeting. Cognitive offloading can be used to support both
prospective (upcoming appointments) and retrospective (meeting notes)
memory. Studies have consistently shown that people perform better
when they have the opportunity to offload information compared to
relying on internal memory alone (Burnett & Richmond, under review;
Gilbert et al., 2023), akin to instructions for standard memory tasks
administered in laboratory settings. Recent studies have also suggested
that cognitive offloading can benefit internal memory by freeing up
resources that can be reallocated to non-offloaded content (i.e., the
saving enhanced memory effect; Storm & Stone, 2015). This suggests

that individuals with poorer internal memory ability (e.g., poor working
memory capacity [WMC]) should benefit most from offloading. However, support for this idea is mixed. While differences in prospective
memory performance due to poor internal working memory ability can
be eliminated by offloading (Ball, Peper, et al., 2022), this has not been
observed in the retrospective memory domain (Brown, 2021; Morrison
& Richmond, 2020). The purpose of the current study was therefore to
better understand the theoretical mechanisms that may underlie the
benefits of offloading across different memory domains using an individual differences approach.

cognitive offloading for prospective memory intentions involves dragging numbered circles in numerical order to different locations on
screen, referred to as the intention offloading task (Gilbert, 2015a). Most
circles are to be dragged to the bottom of the screen, but some ‘special’
circles are indicated by appearing on screen in a color corresponding to
the color appearing at the left, right, or top of the screen before fading to
the same color as all other circles. See Fig. 1 panel A for a depiction of
this task. In the internal memory condition, participants must rely on
their own internal memory to remember the number and intended
location for each special circle while interacting with other circles in
strict numerical order. In the cognitive offloading condition, however,
participants can move the special circles closer to their goal locations out
of order to serve as a reminder of where to move the special circle when
the time comes. Participants perform better when they have the opportunity to (Boldt & Gilbert, 2019; Chiu & Gilbert, 2023; Gilbert,
2015b, 2015a) or are forced to (Ball, Peper, et al., 2022; Engeler &
Gilbert, 2020; Gilbert et al., 2020; Sachdeva & Gilbert, 2020; Scarampi
& Gilbert, 2020) engage in cognitive offloading compared to relying on
internal memory alone.
Another common task in the cognitive offloading literature that

focuses on retrospective memoranda is the letter string offloading task
(Risko & Dunn, 2015). As depicted in Fig. 1 panel C, participants are
presented with letter strings of varying lengths and asked to reproduce
the letter string at the end of each trial. In the internal memory block,
participants must report the letters they were presented in order from
internal memory. In the cognitive offloading block, participants can
create and use an external aid to support their ability to report the
presented letter string. Performance in this task has shown consistent
benefit from having the opportunity to offload (Brown, 2021; Burnett &
Richmond, 2023; Morrison & Richmond, 2020; Risko & Dunn, 2015).
Despite the consistency of findings across the literature around the
benefits of cognitive offloading (Burnett & Richmond, under review;
Gilbert et al., 2023), there are individual differences in the extent to
which people may choose to engage in offloading and the benefits that
they derive from doing so. One individual differences factor that may
relate to offloading behavior and benefit is working memory. Working
memory refers to the attention and memory processes needed to actively
maintain goal-relevant information in the focus of attention and retrieve
information from long-term memory that has been displaced from focal
awareness (Unsworth & Engle, 2007). These same attention and

memory processes are required to successfully complete both retrospective and prospective memory tasks. Therefore, WMC may well be
related to the performance of these two different types of memory tasks
when relying on internal memory alone. At the same time, offloading
reduces the extent to which participants need to engage effortful
memory maintenance processes by increasing the amount of available
environmental support. In this context, a reasonable hypothesis is that
offloading would be more beneficial for participants with lower WMC
compared to those with higher WMC. However, differences among
participants with varying levels of WMC around a host of other cognitive
and non-cognitive factors, including for example metacognitive insights
into their own memory capability, motivation, and interest in avoiding
effort, could lead to patterns whereby participants with low WMC do not
show the expected larger benefit of offloading than participants with
higher WMC.
To test the relationship between WMC and memory task performance in the prospective memory domain, Ball, Peper, et al. (2022)
administered several versions of the intention offloading task that
included blocks of forced internal (no reminder) trials, blocks of forced
external (reminder) trials, and blocks in which participants were able to
choose whether to offload on each trial (optional reminders). Participants with lower WMC performed worse on the intention offloading task
when they had to rely on their own internal memory ability compared to
participants with higher WMC, but this effect was eliminated when
participants were forced to offload. Moreover, participants with low
WMC were more likely to offload when given the choice.
Turning to the retrospective memory domain, Morrison and Richmond (2020) had participants complete a version of the letter string
offloading task that included forced internal (no reminder) and choice
(optional reminders) blocks under varying memory load (i.e., 2–10
letters). As in the Ball, Peper, et al. (2022) study, participants with lower
WMC did worse on the retrospective memory task when they had to rely
on their own internal memory, and the option to offload improved
performance for participants across the board. However, in contrast to
the findings of Ball, Peper, et al. (2022), participants with lower and
higher WMC exhibited similar benefits from offloading (i.e., offloading
did not eliminate internal differences due to working memory) and
WMC was unrelated to the frequency with which participants chose to
offload.
Interestingly, there are two key distinctions between the prospective
intention offloading task and the retrospective letter string offloading
task that may be relevant to consider in the context of these conflicting
patterns. The first is that the intention offloading task necessarily requires participants to complete the ongoing task (dragging most
numbered circles to the usual place) and the special/target circle task in
which specific circles must be moved to specific locations that differ
from those for the ongoing task circles in the same task context. That is,
the intention offloading task is considered dual-task in nature (i.e.,
ongoing task + PM task). By contrast, in the letter string offloading task,
participants need only to attend to and report back the presented letters.
Second, the intention offloading task requires that participants themselves notice the target circles and self-initiate the target circle task
component on their own. Again, this differs from the letter string offloading task in which participants are prompted to provide their responses at the close of each letter string presentation. There are several
other possible theoretically-grounded accounts to consider that may
underlie the discrepant results from these two studies which we highlight below.

to-be-remembered information will successfully be retrieved. Indirect
support for this idea comes from past work showing that participants
offload more frequently in situations in which their internal memory
performance is poor, such as under high memory load or when there are
task interruptions. They also offload more when they receive negative
(as opposed to positive) feedback about their task performance (Gilbert
et al., 2020). More directly, research has found people offload more
frequently when metacognitive predictions of internal memory are
lower than actual performance (Gilbert, 2015b). These findings suggest
that participants rely on metacognitive assessments of their own internal
memory abilities to inform decisions to offload.
Notably, Ball, Peper, and colleagues (2022) found that low and high
WMC participants were equally underconfident in their own internal
memory abilities during the intention offloading task. It is possible,
however, that low WMC participants in the study by Morrison and
Richmond (2020) may have been overconfident, resulting in less effective offloading decisions that would otherwise compensate for their
poorer internal memory ability. One notable difference between the two
task types was that accuracy feedback was provided in the intention
offloading task, whereby circles briefly turned red for incorrect responses and green for correct responses as they moved off screen, but not
in the letter string offloading task. The provision of feedback in the
intention offloading task may have helped participants better calibrate
their metacognitive evaluations to their ability, resulting in more
effective use of reminders. Another difference between these studies that
might impact metacognition was that the study by Ball, Peper, and
colleagues (2022) included forced external trials, which served to
mitigate any differences in performance between low and high ability
participants that may otherwise negatively influence metacognitive
evaluations. The study by Morrison and Richmond (2020), in contrast,
only included choice offloading trials.
An alternative view proposes that people may offload to minimize
the amount of effort they need to expend to complete the task. One way
that people may reduce effort is by relying on an external store to reduce
internal cognitive demand. This stems from the idea that internally
representing information can be cognitively demanding, as committing
multiple items to memory during encoding can be difficult and maintaining these representations can interfere with ongoing activities
(Smith, 2003). Offloading provides a means to avoid engaging these
effortful internal memory processes. Indirect support for this account
comes from findings indicating that participants are more willing to rely
on internal processes when motivated (financially) to do so or when the
demands associated with checking reminders is high (Ball & Peper,
2022; Grinschgl et al., 2021; Sachdeva & Gilbert, 2020). More directly,
research shows that participants study to-be-remembered information
for shorter/longer durations when they know reminders will/will not
later be available during retrieval (Kelly & Risko, 2022; Peper & Ball,
2023). At the same time, the creation of the external store requires
physical effort. In this context, if participants believe that it would be
more effortful to create an external store than to retrieve information
from memory, they may opt not to engage in cognitive offloading (Chiu
& Gilbert, 2023; Gilbert, 2024). In general, participants may weigh the
relative demands of using internal versus external processes when
deciding whether to offload, but it is possible that this computation
differs for prospective and retrospective memory demands.
Moreover, people may choose to offload because it allows for
attention to be reallocated toward other information. For example, the
saving-enhanced memory effect refers to the finding that offloading
some previously learned information can improve memory for newly
learned, but not offloaded, information (Storm & Stone, 2015). In an
early study examining the saving-enhanced memory effect, participants
were shown two lists of words, labeled List A and List B. Participants first
studied List A, after which they were told to save the file or not to save
the file. Next, all participants studied the words on List B and recalled
the words on List B after a 20 s filled delay. Interestingly, Storm and
Stone (2015) found that participants were able to recall a greater

Theoretical accounts of cognitive offloading
One influential account of people’s decision to engage in cognitive
offloading emphasizes the subjective metacognitive evaluations of one’s
own internal memory abilities. According to the metacognitive account,
people use offloading as a memory aid when they are not confident in
their own internal memory abilities to increase the likelihood that the

proportion of List B items on save versus non-save trials (see also Tsai
et al., 2023). This effect replicated in a second experiment where the
authors also demonstrated that the observed effect depended critically
on the reliability of the saving process. These results suggest that when
the saving process is reliable, the act of saving some information frees up
internal memory resources to devote to the encoding and retrieval of
other information. To the extent that the participants in the study by
Ball, Peper, et al. (2022) experienced overall higher memory demand (i.
e., six target circles per trial) than participants in the Morrison and
Richmond (2020) study (i.e., trials ranged in length from 2 to 10 items,
meaning that memory load was low on some trials), low WMC participants may have been more sensitive to the benefits of offloading for
facilitating ongoing task completion in the intention offloading task.
Finally, there are shared and distinct processes that contribute to
memory performance across the two domains. Prospective memory is
comprised of two components: the prospective component involves
noticing the target and becoming aware that an intended action should
be initiated (i.e., remembering that there is something to do), while the
retrospective component involves remembering the contents of the
intention and retrieving the action from long-term memory (i.e.,
remembering what to remember; Einstein & McDaniel, 1990; Guynn
et al., 1998). Critically, the retrospective component is common across
both prospective and retrospective memory tasks, while the prospective
component is unique to prospective memory tasks. Interestingly, Landsiedel and Gilbert (2015) measured brain activity during forced internal
and external blocks and found that offloading reduced signal change in
brain regions associated with remembering what to remember (i.e.,
retrospective component), but not in areas associated with remembering
that something needed to be done (i.e., prospective component). Thus, it
is possible that offloading is particularly effective for individuals with
poor working memory ability in the intention offloading task (Ball,
Peper, et al., 2022) because it frees up resources to allocate toward the
prospective component. In contrast, it is possible that offloading the
retrospective component, which is common to both prospective and
retrospective memory tasks, may be equally beneficial for low and high
WMC participants.

WMC, and would be stronger than has been reported by past research
given that all participants in this study would have had prior experience
completing the offloading tasks in an unaided fashion (forced internal)
as well as experience with offloading (in the forced external block) prior
to the offloading choice trials and participants received feedback about
their performance. However, we considered that it was also possible that
the expected pattern may not emerge given that this pattern did not
emerge in the Morrison and Richmond (2020) study. Third, given that
metacognitive evaluations have been reported to be a better predictor of
offloading behavior than overt memory ability in the intention offloading task (Boldt & Gilbert, 2019; Gilbert et al., 2020), we expected
that, overall, participants would be underconfident in their own internal
memory ability (Gilbert et al., 2020), and that the difference between
actual and predicted performance may increase at higher memory loads.
We further expected that the degree of underconfidence in one’s internal
memory would predict the frequency with which participants chose to
offload. Specifically, we expected that greater underconfidence would
be associated with higher rates of offloading in both tasks. Finally, we
anticipated that lower WMC participants would offload more often than
higher WMC participants when memory load was high. By the time that
participants in the current study completed the trials in the choice block,
they had already gained experience with both carrying out the task using
internal memory alone (forced internal) and with completing the task
when offloading was required (forced external). This experience could
allow them to both learn about their ability to perform the task in an
unaided fashion and the benefits to performance conferred by offloading. However, there are some past data in both tasks that suggest
that internal memory may not be a good predictor of offloading choice
behavior (Morrison & Richmond, 2020; Scarampi & Gilbert, 2021), so
we considered that a plausible alternative hypothesis would be that
WMC would not predict offloading choice behavior in either task.

The current study

Participants

The benefits from offloading as a function of WMC have been found
to differ across prospective and retrospective memory tasks (Ball, Peper,
et al., 2022; Morrison & Richmond, 2020; see also Meyerhoff et al.,
2021). This could reflect important theoretical differences underlying
decisions to offload and benefits from offloading across the two domains
(e.g., metacognitive confidence, prospective vs. retrospective component, etc.), differences in methodology (e.g., feedback, load, choice, etc.)
employed in the two task types, or some combination of both. The
purpose of the current study was therefore to address these discrepant
findings by reducing the methodological differences that existed in past
research (Ball, Peper, et al., 2022; Morrison & Richmond, 2020) while
maintaining the key distinction from past studies: whether the offloading task was retrospective or prospective in nature. That is, the
current study was designed to allow for better understanding of whether
the benefits conferred by offloading are domain-general or if these effects are best considered to be more domain-specific. Moreover, examination of associations with WMC under both forced external and choice
offloading conditions can help to address the potential for non-cognitive
differences (e.g., motivation, effort avoidance) among participants with
varying levels of WMC that could well impact choice offloading behavior
but would be less influential in a forced offloading scenario.
Specifically, we hypothesized that in the forced external block participants would perform similarly regardless of their WMC. However, we
also considered the possibility that this effect would emerge only for the
intention offloading task given that similarity in performance has not
been observed in the letter string offloading task. Second, we hypothesized that the benefit conferred by offloading would be associated with

Full datasets were collected from a total of 363 participants from the
Department of Psychology SONA participant pools at Stony Brook University and the University of Texas at Arlington. Of these, data were
excluded from 112 participants due to failure to meet minimum requirements for inclusion, leaving us with a final useable sample size of
251 participants.1 Specifically, data were excluded for the following
reasons: failing more than 50 % of the attention checks (n = 75),
exhibiting lower performance in the forced external condition compared
to the internal memory condition on one or both of the offloading tasks
(n = 25), failing to offload on an adequate number of trials in the forcedexternal condition (n = 9), responding accurately on less than 50 % of
trials at set size 2 in the choice block of the letter string offloading task
(n = 1), and for failing to score above the guess rate for the processing
portion of one of our complex span working memory tasks (n = 2; see
Richmond et al., 2022). Demographic data were missing for two

anything down outside of the experimental program (i.e., on a piece of paper or

that participants may have responded affirmatively to this question for writing
down task instructions or completion codes and not task stimuli. Due to the
unanticipated ambiguity in this question, we opted to include data from participants who responded affirmatively to this question but who otherwise met
all inclusion criteria in our final sample.

selected to occur 4 times. In the forced internal block, circles were fixed
in position on the screen (other than the current one that needed to be
dragged in sequence) so that target circles could not be moved when
they first appeared. In the forced external block, when a target circle
appeared the task could only be continued after the participant moved it
within the square. In the choice block, participants were given a free
choice to use an internal strategy or set reminders in the upcoming trial.
After receiving the ongoing task instructions, participants performed
a practice trial with 7 circles where they moved the numbers, in order, to
the bottom of the screen. Participants were then given the prospective
memory instructions, followed by a 7-circle practice where the last circle
was a target (set size 1). They had to drag the target circle to the correct
location to proceed without the use of reminders. They then received
practice with target set sizes of 3, 5, and then 7. Following this practice,
participants were asked to predict what percentage of target circles
(from 0-100 %) they thought they would remember to drag to the
appropriate side of the square during the actual task, separately for each
set size. The comparison between predicted performance levels and
actual performance levels formed the basis for our metacognitive calibration variable. Finally, participants were given instructions on how to
set reminders and performed a full 13-circle practice phase (target set
size 7) where reminder usage was required. They then completed the 3
separate blocks of 16 trials as described above.

participants, therefore sample characteristics reported below represent
demographic data for 249 participants. Our final sample had a mean age
of 20.93 years (SD = 6.11 years, Range: 17–57). With respect to race and
ethnicity, 32.70 % of our sample identified as White, 28.10 % as Asian/
Pacific Islander, 22.90 % as Hispanic/Latinx, 11.20 % as Black, 3.61 %
of participants chose the response ‘Other/Unknown,’ and 2.01 % of
participants did not provide a response to this question. All procedures
were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Stony
Brook University and University of Texas at Arlington.
Our a priori power analysis indicated a necessary sample size of 284
participants. However, the large number of data exclusions based on our
exclusion criteria left us with a slightly smaller sample size than we
powered for. Nonetheless, a post-hoc sensitivity analysis suggested that
we were well powered to detect a significant bivariate correlation between internal memory performance and offloading behavior as small as
− .16 with 80 % power. This correlation is in line with the effect that we
originally powered the study to detect.
Materials
Intention offloading task
The materials and stimuli for the intention offloading task were
adapted from Gilbert et al. (2020; see Fig. 1 panel A for a task schematic). At the start of each trial, six yellow circles were presented within
a square on the computer. Each circle contained a number (1–6) and
participants were to drag the circles in ascending numerical order to the
bottom of the square. Each time a circle was dragged to the bottom of the
square, a new circle appeared in its original location, continuing the
numerical sequence until participants had been presented with all circles in a given trial. Occasionally, new circles (i.e., targets) initially
appeared in blue, orange, or pink, rather than yellow, which corresponded with the left, top, and right side of the square, respectively. Two
seconds after appearing on the screen, the color faded to yellow so that
they matched the other circles. When a target appeared (e.g., in orange),
this represented an instruction that it should eventually be dragged to its
corresponding side of the square (e.g., top) when it was reached in the
numerical sequence, representing the intended future action to be
associated with that circle. This key manipulation serves to differentiate
the intention offloading task from a standard short-term/working
memory task. For example, a participant first drags the circle labeled
’1’ to the bottom of the screen where it disappears. Next, an orange
circle labeled ’7’ appears in its place, fading to yellow after two seconds.
Meanwhile, the participant drags circles 2–6 to the bottom of the screen,
before dragging the ’7’ circle to the top. There was no filler task between
the appearance of a target circle and retrieval, other than completion of
the ongoing task (dragging the circles numbered 2–6). In addition, the
retention interval (i.e., the time from the appearance of a target circle
until the target action was to be carried out) varied as a function of how
quickly a given participant was able to complete each circle-dragging
task. Importantly, targets can be ‘remembered’ in two different ways.
Participants can rely on their own internal representation of where it
should eventually be dragged (i.e., no reminder) or can set an external
reminder as soon as it appears by moving it near the location (e.g., top)
where it eventually needs to be dragged.
The set size per trial was either 1, 3, 5, or 7 prospective memory
targets, respectively, which corresponded to 7, 9, 11, or 13 ongoing task
stimuli presented in ascending numerical order. The targets were
randomly selected to appear for circles numbered 7–13 and were
randomly allocated to the left, top, and right positions of the square.
Feedback was provided by the circle changing color before disappearing
if dragged to the correct location (green) or incorrect location (red). All
circles correctly dragged to the bottom of the box turned purple before
disappearing.
There were 3 separate blocks presented in a fixed order: forced internal (no reminder), forced external (reminder), and choice. Within
each block, there were 16 trials, such that each set size was randomly

Letter string offloading task
Participants were presented with letter strings ranging in length from
two to eight letters in length by twos (2, 4, 6, or 8 letters; 4 cycles of each
set size per block). Presentation was audiovisual, with letters being
spoken aloud as well as displayed on the screen at a rate of 1 s each with
a 500 ms ISI. Prior to task initiation, participants underwent a procedure
to ensure that they were able to hear the audio portion of the task at a
comfortable volume. Participants also completed internal memory
practice trials (4 trials at set size 2) to get comfortable with the task and
procedure for reporting the presented stimuli.
After the practice trials, participants completed one trial at each set
size (2, 4, 6, and 8) using internal memory, and were then asked to
predict what percentage of letters they would be able to recall in the
correct order at each set size during the actual task. Comparison of
predicted performance levels to actual performance levels formed the
basis for our metacognitive calibration variable.
At the start of each trial, participants were shown a screen that told
them how many letters they would be presented in the upcoming trial.
Immediately after this screen, letter presentation began up to the length
indicated on the initial screen. Immediately following presentation of
the last letter in the trial, participants were asked to report the presented
letters in serial order. In the internal memory block, participants had to
rely on their own internal memory to reproduce the presented information. In the forced offloading block, participants were required to
type the letter into a text box on screen as each letter was presented;
their typed notes were made available to them at test. In the offloading
choice block, participants had the opportunity to type letters during the
encoding phase but were not required to do so. Typed letters were made
available to them at test. After providing their responses for each trial,
participants were provided feedback about their performance. Specifically, participants were told if their response was correct, incorrect, or if
there was no response detected at the end of each trial. See Fig. 1 panel C
for a task schematic.
Complex span working memory tasks
Participants also completed shortened versions of the Operation Span
and Symmetry Span tasks (Foster et al., 2015; Unsworth et al., 2005).
Shortened versions of these tasks have been shown to have adequate
reliability (Foster et al., 2015), and are less onerous and time consuming
for participants to complete than the full (standard) task versions. Here,
participants completed only two blocks of each task rather than three
blocks as is the norm for the standard version of these tasks.

Both tasks consist of a processing component and a storage component, presented in an interleaved fashion. Participants are told that they
should report the storage items in the order that they were presented.
Participants were not told ahead of time how many items they would
have to remember for each trial. After inputting their responses for the
storage task participants were provided with feedback about their performance level on both the processing and storage portions of the task
before moving on to the next trial.
Briefly, Operation Span consisted of participants solving simple math
problems (processing) and remembering letters (storage), presented in
an interleaved fashion. Trials ranged in length from three to seven letters. See Fig. 1 panel B for a task schematic. Symmetry Span involves
making symmetry decisions regarding an 8x8 black-and-white grid
about the vertical axis (processing) and remembering locations highlighted in red in a 4x4 grid (storage). Set sizes ranged from two to five
items. See Fig. 1 panel D for a task schematic.

Procedure
Study procedures were completed online in the following fixed task
order: intention offloading task, Operation Span, letter string offloading
task, Symmetry Span. Each offloading task consisted of three blocks of
trials presented in a fixed order: forced internal, forced external,
cognitive offloading choice. Task order and block order within the offloading tasks were fixed in order to best capture individual differences
(Robison et al., 2023). The intention offloading task was completed via a
web-based interface that was programmed using Google Web Toolkit
(https://gwtproject.org) and self-hosted by the researchers; all other
tasks were completed via E-Prime GO (Psychology Software Tools,
2020). After participants completed all four tasks, they provided their
demographic information, completed a post-study questionnaire, and
were debriefed. The study took approximately 2 h in total to complete,
and participants were awarded partial course credit for their participation. Participants were permitted 24 h to complete all study procedures.

Does the opportunity to offload (forced external, choice offloading) result
in high and low WMC participants performing more similarly to one
another than they do in the internal memory condition?
Forced offloading
To test whether individuals with varying levels of WMC would
perform more similarly to one another on the offloading tasks when
offloading is required compared to when participants were required to
rely on internal memory, we conducted a 2 (task: intention offloading
vs. letter string) x 2 (load: high [levels 3 and 4] vs. low [levels 1 and 2])
x 2 (condition: forced internal vs. forced external) x WMC (continuous)
ANCOVA.2 Effects are reported in Table 2 for brevity. Of specific interest
is the significant four-way interaction (p = .001), which motivated us to
conduct the follow-up tests reported below. The significant four-way
interaction indicates that task performance differs as a function of
load, condition, task, and WMC. See Fig. 2 panel A. Follow-up analyses
were conducted separately for each task.
Prospective Memory: Intention offloading task. Our planned
follow up 2 (load: high [levels 3 and 4] vs. low [levels 1 and 2]) x 2
(condition: forced internal vs. forced external) x WMC (continuous)
ANCOVA revealed a significant main effect of load (F (1, 249) = 533.76,
p < .001), condition (F (1, 249) = 585.99, p < .001), and WMC (F (1,
249) = 25.90, p < .001). These main effects were qualified by significant
load x condition (F (1, 249) = 404.85, p < .001), load x WMC (F (1, 249)
= 4.82, p = .029), and condition x WMC (F (1, 249) = 30.31, p < .001)
interactions. The three-way load x condition x WMC interaction (F (1,
249) = 1. 82, p = .179) was not significant.
Despite not observing a significant three-way interaction, we followed up the significant condition x WMC interaction by examining the
effects at high and low memory load separately in order to present
consistent analyses across tasks. Under low memory load, there was a
significant main effect of WMC (F (1, 249) = 17.86, p < .001), a

Statistical approach
Our key research questions and hypotheses were pre-registered, but
not all of our pre-registered analyses are reported in the manuscript. Preregistered hypotheses and analyses not reported here can be found in the
Supplemental Materials document. We also conducted some additional
exploratory analyses to fully characterize our patterns across different
offloading conditions (forced external vs. choice) and task (intention
offloading vs. letter string offloading) that we report here. Such analyses
are clearly marked as exploratory throughout the document.
Results
Results from our key research questions and corresponding analyses
are presented below. False discovery rate corrections for multiple
comparisons were applied for correlations conducted at each memory
load level.
Descriptive statistics for all measures are presented in Table 1.
Reliability for a few metrics in the intention offloading task and the
letter string offloading task were below the acceptable range. Specifically, Cronbach’s alphas for both the letter string offloading task and
the intention offloading task were below the acceptable range (i.e., .70
or higher; Hair et al., 2010) in the forced internal and external blocks.
Acceptable ranges for skew and kurtosis were based on recommendations from Kline (2011). In addition, skew was outside of the acceptable
range (<= 3) for choice offloading blocks in both tasks and in the forced
external block for the intention offloading task. Similarly, kurtosis was
found to be outside of the acceptable range (<= 8) for the forced
external and choice blocks in both offloading tasks. For analyses
involving these measures, we conducted non-parametric rank-based

Our analysis plan on OSF did not clearly state how WMC would be
conceptualized for the current analysis. In addition, for brevity, all analyses
reported below to test this question separates load into high (combining performance at load levels 3 and 4) vs. low (combining performance at load levels
1 and 2) categories rather than examining all four load levels, as visual inspection of the data suggested similar patterns of performance for high and low
memory load trials.

between choice offloading and forced internal conditions. As above, we
conducted a 2 (task: intention offloading vs. letter string) x 2 (load: high
[levels 3 and 4] vs. low [levels 1 and 2]) x 2 (condition: forced internal
vs. choice offloading) x WMC (continuous) ANCOVA. Effects are reported in Table 3 for brevity. Of note, the four-way interaction again
reached significance (p = .002), and all other patterns observed here
were qualitatively similar to what was observed for our four-way
ANCOVA involving the forced external condition (see Tables 2 and
3).3 Therefore, we again conducted follow-up analyses for each task
separately.
Prospective Memory: Intention offloading task. Our follow up 2
(load: high vs. low) x 2 (condition: forced internal vs. choice offloading)
x WMC (continuous) ANCOVA revealed a significant main effect of load
(F (1, 249) = 433.31, p < .001), a significant main effect of condition (F
(1, 249) = 438.94, p < .001), and a significant main effect of WMC (F (1,
249) = 37.18, p < .001). These main effects were qualified by significant
load x condition (F (1, 249) = 369.75, p < .001), load x WMC (F (1, 249)
= 7.41, p = .007), and condition x WMC (F (1, 249) = 13.03, p < .001)
interactions. The three-way load x condition x WMC interaction was not
significant (F (1, 249) = 0.22, p = .643). Nevertheless, to maintain
consistency with the forced offloading analyses reported above, we
followed up this analysis by examining the interaction between condition and WMC separately under low and high memory load. Consistent
with the forced offloading analyses, significant main effects of condition
(low: F (1, 249) = 67.62, p < .001; high: F (1, 249) = 551.63, p < .001)
and WMC (low: F (1, 249) = 26.36, p < .001; high: F (1, 249) = 29.38, p
< .001) emerged; these were qualified by significant condition x WMC
interactions (low: F (1, 249) = 12.96, p < .001; high: F (1, 249) = 7.22, p
= .008) under both low and high memory load. Participants with lower
WMC benefitted more from having the choice to offload than participants with higher WMC in the intention offloading task regardless of
memory load. Again, participants with varying levels of WMC performed more similarly to one another in the choice offloading condition
compared to the forced internal condition in accordance with our predictions. See Fig. 2 panel B (left panel).
Retrospective Memory: Letter string offloading task. Our follow
up 2 (load: high vs. low) x 2 (condition: forced internal vs. choice offloading) x WMC (continuous) ANCOVA revealed significant main effects
of load (F (1, 249) = 1283.47, p < .001), condition (F (1, 249) = 562.58,
p < .001) and WMC (F (1, 249) = 64.23, p < .001). These effects were
qualified by significant load x condition (F (1, 249) = 769.67, p < .001),
load x WMC (F (1, 249) = 23.21, p < .001) and condition x WMC (F (1,
249) = 6.59, p = .001) interactions. These effects were further qualified
by a significant three-way load x condition x WMC interaction (F (1,
249) = 14.40, p < .001). We followed up this significant three-way
interaction by examining the interaction between condition and WMC
under low and high memory load separately. Under low load, only the
main effect of WMC was significant (F (1, 249) = 34.81, p < .001; main
effect of condition: F (1, 249) = 1.15, p = .2844; condition x WMC
interaction: F (1, 249) = 0.70, p = .405) Under high memory load,
significant main effects of both condition (F (1, 249) = 752.82, p < .001
and WMC (F (1, 249) = 52.90, p < .001) emerged, as well as a significant
condition x WMC interaction (F (1, 249) = 11.26, p < .001). Participants
with lower WMC benefitted more from having the choice to offload than
participants with higher WMC in the letter string offloading task only
under high memory load. In addition, participants with varying levels of
WMC performed more similarly to one another in the choice offloading
condition compared to the forced internal condition under high memory
load, somewhat in line with our predictions. See Fig. 2 panel B (right
panel).

significant main effect of condition (F (1, 249) = 98.06, p < .001) and a
significant WMC x condition interaction (F (1, 249) = 24.05, p < .001).
A similar pattern emerged under high memory load (main effect of
WMC: F (1, 249) = 21.77, p < .001; main effect of condition: F (1, 249)
= 674.95, p < .001; WMC x condition interaction: F (1, 249) = 18.54, p
< .001). Overall, these data suggest that participants with lower WMC
benefitted more from being forced to offload than participants with
higher WMC in the intention offloading task under both low and high
memory load. Further, these results support our hypothesis that participants with varying levels of WMC would perform more similarly to
one another in the forced external condition compared to the forced
internal condition. See Fig. 2 panel A (left panel).
Retrospective Memory: Letter string offloading task. Our planned follow up 2 (load: high [levels 3 and 4] vs. low [levels 1 and 2]) x 2
(condition: forced internal vs. forced external) x WMC (continuous)
ANCOVA revealed a significant main effect of load (F (1, 249) =
1103.91, p < .001), condition (F (1, 249) = 835.89, p < .001), and WMC
(F (1, 249) = 50.55, p < .001). These effects were qualified by significant
load x condition (F (1, 249) = 885.56, p < .001), load x WMC (F (1, 249)
= 16.40, p < .001) and condition x WMC (F (1, 249) = 22.41, p < .001)
interactions. These effects were further qualified by a significant threeway load x condition x WMC interaction (F (1, 249) = 20.47, p < .001).
We followed up this significant three-way interaction by examining the
interaction between condition and span separately at low and high
memory loads. Under low load, only a significant main effect of WMC
was revealed (F (1, 249) = 32.01, p < .001). The main effect of condition
(F (1, 249) = 3.10, p = .080) and the condition x WMC interaction (F (1,
249) = 0.59, p = .441) were not significant. Under low memory load,
participants with higher WMC outperformed participants with lower
WMC overall. Under high memory load, though, a different pattern
emerged. Here, a significant main effect of condition (F (1, 249) =
976.57, p < .001) and WMC (F (1, 249) = 36.94, p < .001) emerged. This
effect was qualified by a significant condition x WMC interaction (F (1,
249) = 24.38, p < .001). These patterns indicate that participants with
lower WMC benefitted more from being forced to offload than participants with higher WMC in the letter string offloading task, but only
under high memory load. Moreover, these data again support our hypothesis that participants with varying levels of WMC would perform
more similarly to one another in the forced external condition compared
to the forced internal condition. See Fig. 2 panel A (right panel).
Choice offloading
To determine whether the patterns observed above are similar when
people are given a choice to offload rather than being required to do so,
we conducted a parallel exploratory analysis focused on the comparison

3
In our non-parametric analysis, the task x condition interaction was not
significant (p =.364).
4
In our non-parametric analysis, the main effect of condition under low
memory load was significant (p =.032).

Simultaneous regressions
Finally, we conducted additional exploratory analyses using simultaneous regressions to predict benefit scores in the choice offloading
condition only (performance in the choice offloading block – performance in the internal memory block) from WMC and offloading frequency under high and low memory load. In the intention offloading
task, the overall model was significant for both high and low memory
load (high: F (2, 248) = 16.17, R2 = 0.12, adjusted R2 = 0.11; p < .001;
low: F (2, 248) = 13.58, R2 = 0.10, adjusted R2 = 0.09; p < .001).
Offloading frequency (all ps < .001) and WMC (all ps < .001) were
significant predictors in both the high and low load models. In the letter
string offloading task, the overall model was significant for both high
and low memory load (high: F (2, 248) = 45.02, R2 = 0.27, adjusted R2
= 0.26; p < .001; low: F (2, 248) = 3.75, R2 = 0.03, adjusted R2 = 0.02; p
= .020). Offloading frequency was a significant predictor in both the
high and low load models (largest p = .010) but WMC was only a significant predictor in the high load model (high load p < .001; low load p
= .390). In both tasks, as offloading frequency increased, so too did the
benefit to performance conferred by offloading. Moreover, the benefit to
performance afforded by offloading increased as WMC decreased in the
intention offloading task overall and in the letter string task at high
memory loads. These findings suggest that participants who made the
greatest use of the offloading strategy received the largest benefits to
performance, and that participants with lower WMC tended to benefit
from using offloading more than participants with higher WMC.

Note. WMC was included as a z-score in the above analysis.

When offloading was required, we computed the benefit scores as performance in the forced offloading condition minus performance in the
forced internal condition. When offloading was a choice, we computed
the benefit scores as performance in the choice offloading condition
minus performance in the forced internal condition.
Bivariate correlations
Below we report the results of our bivariate correlations5 between
the benefit of offloading and WMC at low (levels 1 and 2) and high
(levels 3 and 4) memory load for each task separately. Correlation
strength was then compared across tasks.
Forced Offloading. In general, the benefit afforded by offloading (i.
e., forced external performance minus forced internal performance)
under high memory load was negatively correlated with WMC. In the
intention offloading task, we observed significant correlations between
offloading benefit and WMC at both high (r (249) = -.26, adjusted p <
.001) and low memory loads (r (249) = -.30, adjusted p < .001). In the
letter string offloading task, we observed significant correlations between offloading benefit and WMC at high (r (249) = -.30, adjusted p <
.001), but not low (r (249) = -.05, adjusted p = .441) memory load.
Correlations across tasks differed significantly at low (adjusted p =
.007), but not high (adjusted p = .640), memory load. In general, these
results suggests that those with lower WMC benefit more from cognitive
offloading when offloading is required, particularly under high memory
load.
Choice Offloading. The benefit afforded by offloading (i.e., choice
offloading performance minus forced internal performance) was negatively correlated with WMC under high memory load in both tasks.
Specifically, in the intention offloading task, we observed significant
correlations between offloading benefit and WMC at both high (r (249)
= -.17, adjusted p = .008) and low (r (249) = -.22, adjusted p = .001)
memory loads. In the letter string offloading task, we only observed
significant correlations between offloading benefit and WMC under high
load (r (249) = -.21, adjusted p = .002) but not low load (r (249) = .05,
adjusted p = .405). Across tasks, the correlations did not differ under
high load (adjusted p = .618), but task differences were observed at low
load (adjusted p = .002). In general, these results suggests that those

Is metacognition related to offloading choice behavior?
To investigate the association between metacognition and offloading
choice behavior, we followed the plan outlined in our preregistration to
correlate metacognitive calibration (predicted performance minus
actual performance in the forced internal condition) with offloading
choice behavior. We tested whether participants’ underconfidence was
associated with offloading choice behavior (see Boldt & Gilbert, 2019;
Gilbert et al., 2020; Sachdeva & Gilbert, 2020).6 Contrary to our hypothesis that greater underconfidence would be associated with offloading more often when participants had the opportunity to do so, we
did not observe significant correlations between metacognitive calibration and offloading choice behavior in the intention offloading task
for low (r (249) = -0.04, adjusted p = .544) or high (r (249) = 0.01,
adjusted p = .544) memory load. Similar patterns were observed in the
letter string offloading task for both low (r (249) = 0.14, adjusted p =
.986) and high (r (249) = 0.10, adjusted p = .986) memory load. We
note, however, that metacognitive calibration is based on a difference
score. Difference scores can have low reliability (e.g., Lord, 1956).
Indeed, we found that reliability for our metacognitive calibration
measure was outside of the typical acceptable range for both the
intention offloading task (Cronbach’s α = .67) and the letter string offloading task (Cronbach’s α = .67). However, reliability was within the
acceptable range for global metacognitive confidence (see Table 1).
Therefore, to further test whether overall metacognitive judgments
were associated with offloading choice behavior with a more reliable
measure, we conducted an exploratory analysis repeating the approach
described above that referenced participant’s metacognitive responses
directly rather than metacognitive calibration. Here, we observed a
significant negative association only in the intention offloading task
under low memory load (r (249) = -0.14, adjusted p = .023). At high
memory load in this task (r (249) = 0.02, adjusted p = .624) and for both
low (r (249) = 0.06, adjusted p = .844) and high (r (249) = -0.01,

A hypothesis around the benefit of choice offloading compared to forced
internal memory being more related to WMC than in past research was preregistered; however, we did not outline a specific statistical test that corresponded to this hypothesis. Our analyses involving the benefit of forced
external trials compared to forced internal trials as related to WMC are
exploratory.

While this hypothesis was pre-registered, we did not outline a specific
statistical test that corresponded to this hypothesis.

choice condition always came after both forced internal and forced
external trials. Additionally, participants were given feedback on their
performance after each trial, which was only done previously in the
intention offloading task. It is possible that this prior task experience
and/or feedback allowed participants to make use of offloading more
optimally than the sample reported by Morrison and Richmond (2020).
At the same time, however, in light of the nonsignificant correlations
between WMC and offloading frequency, these findings suggest that
participants with lower WMC may not have used the strategy as
frequently as they should have in order to obtain maximal performance
benefit (see Scarampi & Gilbert, 2021 for similar results with older
adults). This interpretation is bolstered by the pattern observed in the
letter string offloading task comparing performance in the choice offloading and forced internal blocks where a significant WMC x condition
interaction was not observed under low memory load. Why lower WMC
participants may not make use of the offloading strategy as much as they
should given their more limited internal memory capability is an
interesting avenue to be explored in future studies. An important future
study would be to directly examine whether the benefit of offloading for
participants with varying levels of WMC differs depending on whether
feedback is provided.
Surprisingly, neither metacognitive calibration nor WMC were found
to be related to the frequency with which participants chose to offload,
which diverges from past findings with the intention offloading task
(Ball, Peper, et al., 2022; Boldt & Gilbert, 2019; Gilbert et al., 2020;
Sachdeva & Gilbert, 2020). Moreover, the role of metacognition in offloading behavior in the letter string offloading task was tested here for
the first time, so additional research is needed to replicate the reported
pattern for this task. However, we note that the finding that WMC was
not related to offloading frequency does replicate prior work in the letter
string offloading task (Brown, 2021; Morrison & Richmond, 2020).
With respect to why the expected relationship between WMC and
metacognitive calibration was not observed in the current study, it is
possible that our measure of metacognition was too coarse or was
plagued by issues of low reliability. To avoid inflating the time and
demands of the task battery beyond what participants were already
being required to do in the context of the current study, we opted to use a
relatively simple approach similar to what has been used in prior
research for testing metacognitive associations with offloading choice
behavior (see for example Ball, Peper, et al., 2022; Boldt & Gilbert,
2019). We also opted to use this relatively simple approach to measure
metacognition given the asynchronous and unsupervised nature of data
collection for this study. Importantly, however, we did observe low
Cronbach’s alphas for our metacognitive calibration measure in both
tasks, suggesting that low reliability for this measure could explain our
unexpected patterns. Analyses focused on the responses that participants
provided to the metacognitive questions themselves, rather than the
calibration measure, only fared slightly better. That is, the expected
association between metacognition and offloading behavior only
emerged under low memory load in the intention offloading task.
Despite using an approach to measuring metacognition that has been
used in prior research, it is possible that we failed to observe strong
support for the expected relationship between metacognition and offloading behavior in the choice offloading block because the choice block
in the current study was always presented as the final block after participants had extensive task experience. In addition, the large task battery used in the current study differs from past literature on this topic; it
is possible that participants’ awareness of the number of tasks and the
length of the study overall may have impacted their metacognitive assessments. Future studies designed to test questions around metacognitive contributions to offloading behavior may choose to include
fewer tasks and a larger number of measurements of metacognition.
Future studies may also focus on item-level metacognitive judgements
instead of or in addition to global-level measures of metacognition. For
example, researchers may choose to sample metacognitive beliefs multiple times throughout the task, use a larger number of probes embedded

adjusted p = .844) memory load in the letter string offloading task no
significant associations were observed.
Together, the general lack of association between metacognitive
assessments and offloading choice behavior, particularly under high
memory load in the intention offloading task where this relationship has
been reported in the past, was surprising. We return to this point in the
Discussion.
Is WMC related to offloading choice behavior?
Finally, we tested whether offloading frequency (e.g., the proportion
of trials on which participants chose to offload) was correlated with
WMC according to our preregistered analysis plan. In the intention
offloading task, we did not observe significant correlations between
offloading frequency and WMC for either low (r (249) = -0.08, adjusted
p = .212) or high (r (249) = 0.06, adjusted p = .811) memory load.
Again, similar patterns emerged in the letter string offloading task (low
load: r (249) = -0.01, adjusted p = .907; high load: r (249) = 0.14,
adjusted p = .985). Unsurprisingly, the correlations at low and high
memory load across tasks did not differ statistically (adjusted p = .310
for both low and high memory load comparisons). These results support
an alternative hypothesis that we considered (outlined in our preregistration) that WMC would not be significantly associated with offloading
choice behavior in either task.
Discussion
The current study addressed a discrepancy in the literature around
the relationship between working memory ability and the use of and
benefit afforded by cognitive offloading in the prospective and retrospective memory domains. The procedures for two commonly used
offloading tasks – the intention offloading task and the letter string
offloading task – were aligned with one another on several design dimensions while preserving the core key difference between the two tasks
(i.e., memory domain). Overall, findings across tasks and offloading
conditions were fairly consistent, though we note that stronger patterns
were observed for forced-external compared to choice offloading analyses in some instances. First, many of the results of our omnibus fourway ANOVA for forced-external and choice offloading were qualitatively similar, including significant four-way interactions in both analyses. Further, participants with lower and higher levels of WMC
performed more similarly to one another under the forced-external
offloading condition compared to relying on internal memory alone in
both the intention offloading task and the letter string offloading task,
particularly under high load. These findings supported our hypotheses,
and the similarity in findings across tasks and offloading conditions is
noteworthy. Results of these analyses suggest that offloading can be an
effective strategy to ‘close the gap’ in performance that is typically
exhibited for participants with low versus high WMC.
In addition, participants with lower WMC tended to benefit more
from offloading both when they were forced to offload and when they
had the choice to offload, and the magnitude of this benefit was similar
at high memory loads (load levels 3 and 4) across tasks. Moreover, the
expected pattern did emerge for the benefit conferred by offloading in
the choice block compared to the internal memory block. In both tasks,
the frequency with which participants chose to offload was associated
with larger benefits to performance. Critically, performance benefits
from offloading under high memory load in both tasks were negatively
associated with WMC, suggesting that the benefits of offloading were
larger for individuals with lower WMC.
The finding that WMC was associated with offloading benefit at high
memory load in the choice offloading condition is consistent with the
pattern reported by Ball, Peper, and colleagues (2022) but stands in
contrast to the findings reported by Morrison and Richmond (2020).
Importantly, in the current study, participants had the opportunity to
complete a forced external block, and block order was fixed such that the

within the task, and/or include retrospective confidence judgements or
other such procedures to better characterize the relationship between
metacognition and offloading choice behavior. Another possibility is
that the influence of metacognitive beliefs on cognitive offloading may
be stronger when participant rewards are determined by task performance. In designs such as the present study, where participants receive a
fixed reward for participation, non-metacognitive factors may have a
proportionately greater influence on offloading strategies (Ngai &
Gilbert, 2024).
The lack of association found between WMC and offloading choice
behavior in the current study stands in contrast to what was observed by
Ball, Peper, et al. (2022), but is consistent with the pattern observed by
Morrison and Richmond (2020). Specifically, Ball, Peper, and colleagues
(2022) found that low WMC participants were more likely to offload
when given the choice. However, a critical difference in that study was
that choosing to offload was associated with different point values
(ranging from 2 to 8) while choosing to complete the task internally was
always associated with a higher fixed value (i.e., 10 points). This
allowed for the examination of whether working memory was associated
with optimal offloading decisions based on one’s own forced internal and
external memory ability (e.g., if a participant can remember on average
5 of 10 targets internally and 10 of 10 targets externally, then they
should choose to offload when given a value of 6 points but not when
given a value of 4 points). Working memory was not associated with the
optimality of offloading, but low WMC participants did offload more
overall (independent of value). Based on these findings, coupled with
the fact that metacognitive calibration was not associated with working
memory, it was suggested by Ball, Peper, and colleagues (2022) that low
WMC participants may choose to offload to avoid effort. The results of
the current study are not consistent with this interpretation, as WMC
was also not associated with offloading frequency. However, it is unclear
whether the two procedures are directly comparable, as the current
study did not include point values that might otherwise change decisions
to offload. Future studies may explore whether the use of point values
specifically encourages the expected patterns to emerge.
An alternative explanation as to why offloading choice behavior was
not associated with WMC is referred to as “strategy perseveration.”
Scarampi and Gilbert (2020) had participants either use their own internal memory ability or offload in the first block, while in the second
block participants were given the choice to offload. Results showed that
participants chose to offload more frequently in the second block if they
had previously been forced to offload than if they had to use their own
memory, suggesting that choice decisions were made based on prior
strategies. In the current study, participants completed forced internal
and external trials prior to the choice trials, but external trials always
occurred immediately prior. The finding that working memory was not
associated with offloading frequency suggests that low WMC participants are not more likely to perseverate on an immediately prior strategy than high WMC participants.
Together, the results of the current study are inconsistent with the
idea the prospective and retrospective memory task performance and
offloading behavior relies on fundamentally different mechanisms. The
dual component model of working memory (Unsworth & Engle, 2007)
argues that working memory underlies the ability to flexibly control
both attention and memory. Ball and colleagues (Ball, Wiemers, et al.,
2022) have argued that the relation between working memory and
prospective memory occurs because attention is needed to remember
that something needs to be done (i.e., the prospective component) and
memory processes are needed to remember what needs to be done (i.e.,
the retrospective component). In retrospective memory tasks, participants only need to remember what needs to be done. However, attentional processes are still needed at encoding to focus attention on to-beremembered information (Unsworth, 2019) and are likely re-engaged at
retrieval to reinstate the temporal context needed to retrieve information in serial order (Spillers & Unsworth, 2011). Thus, attention and
memory processes that differ as a function of WMC are likely operating

in both tasks, and offloading can reduce the demands placed on both
processes.
Overall, our findings do not provide overwhelming support for any
extant theories of cognitive offloading. Perhaps most surprisingly, our
current findings did not provide strong support for a metacognitive account for offloading behavior in either task context. This finding stands
in contrast to prior work using variants of the intention offloading task
reported here (Ball, Peper, et al., 2022; Boldt & Gilbert, 2019; Gilbert
et al., 2020; Sachdeva & Gilbert, 2020; Scarampi & Gilbert, 2021). It is
possible that the methodological changes made for the purposes of this
study to better align with the letter string offloading task may have
impacted the use of metacognition to guide offloading behavior in unexpected ways. Patterns from our comparisons involving forced external
and choice offloading conditions were similar, though the lack of significant correlations between WMC and offloading choice behavior may
suggest some subtle support for the effort avoidance account. That is,
participants may not have made best use of the opportunity to offload
when they had the choice to do so rather than being forced to offload
due to the effort associated with creating the external reminder. This
was particularly true for lower WMC participants who stood to benefit
from the performance boost afforded by offloading but didn’t always
choose to offload as much as they should have given their more limited
internal memory capability. However, we note that manipulations that
serve to increase the effort associated with making and/or using offloaded notes would be better suited to test this account (e.g., Grinschgl
et al., 2021). Our findings do not seem to provide strong support for the
saving enhanced memory account, though participants were not limited
in the amount of information that they were allowed to offload in the
choice offloading condition in the current study. Such a manipulation
may encourage participants to offload to-be-remembered information
more selectively than was observed here and may better demonstrate
the potential for offloading to produce the saving enhanced memory
effect (see for example Fellers & Storm, 2024).
Despite not finding clear support for any extant accounts of cognitive
offloading, we believe that the overall consistency of our findings across
tasks in the prospective and retrospective memory domains suggests that
the theoretical basis for offloading benefits may be similar across tasks.
Thus, our results support the development of domain-general theories of
cognitive offloading. However, different theoretical accounts may be
needed to explain the mechanism(s) by which cognitive offloading
confers benefits to performance and the behavior exhibited by participants when they have the choice to engage in offloading, including why
some sub groups (including participants with low WMC and older
adults; see also Scarampi & Gilbert, 2021) do not make optimal use of
the opportunity to offload. These are important future directions for the
field to address.
Limitations
There are a few limitations of the current study that should be noted.
First, data for the current study were collected online, and participants
completed the tasks in an unsupervised manner. While our exclusion
criteria make us confident that we retained data only from participants
who completed the tasks as instructed and exhibited performance within
a reasonable range, it is possible that in-person studies would produce
different patterns of results given the more stringent testing conditions
that can be enforced in the lab. In addition, participants in the current
study were permitted to complete the task battery over a 24-hour period,
rather than in one or two in-laboratory sessions as would be the typical
approach for in person studies. Participants also completed these tasks
on their own devices rather than using a standardized laboratory setup.
Therefore, it is possible that these methodological differences necessitated by the online data collection method had an impact on the current
pattern of results. At the same time, the use of online data collection in
this study increases the potential for these findings to translate to realworld behaviors outside of the lab. Although a recent meta-analysis
11

L.L. Richmond et al.

Journal of Memory and Language 142 (2025) 104617

suggests that patterns do not differ significantly based on data collection
site (i.e., in person vs. online; see Burnett & Richmond, under review),
future research could examine whether the patterns reported here
replicate for lab-based data collection.
It should be noted that participants from across the WMC spectrum
exhibited near-ceiling performance in the forced-external condition.
This may not be desirable from the standpoint of assessing individual
differences. However, we note that WMC was correlated with benefits of
offloading at high memory load in both offloading tasks and in both
offloading blocks (forced-external, choice offloading) and at low memory load for the intention offloading task in both offloading blocks.
These data suggest that participants with higher WMC still stood to
benefit from offloading when they were required or could choose to do
so relative to relying on their own internal memory. Moreover, the
general consistency of findings that emerged from comparisons
involving the forced-external block and choice offloading block serve to
clarify that any effects associated with WMC are not simply due to
suboptimal choice behavior in lower WMC participants. However,
future research may choose to include higher memory loads than were
used in the current study to avoid participants performing near ceiling in
offloading trials.
Finally, we note that our load manipulation was not directly comparable across tasks. That is, although both tasks contained four load
levels, the intention offloading task contained memory loads of 1, 3, 5,
and 7 while the letter string offloading task contained memory loads of
2, 4, 6, and 8. However, we note that in both tasks load increased by two
items at each load level from the lowest memory load. The lowest
memory load was not consistent across tasks because we wanted demands associated with each memory load to be roughly similar across
tasks. Based on previous research we expected that remembering 1
intention and 2 letters would be relatively low demand for all participants, and that remembering 7 intentions and 8 letters would be a much
higher demand. In examining the means across tasks, performance levels
were generally comparable across the first three loads, although performance dropped more considerably at the highest load in the retrospective letter string offloading task compared to the prospective
intention offloading task. Despite our efforts to equate these tasks in
terms of difficulty, it is possible that participants did not experience
these tasks as comparably difficult. Future research comparing prospective and retrospective memory offloading may wish to directly
equate memory loads across tasks to test whether patterns reported here
persist under those conditions. It may also be useful to collect subjective
difficulty ratings across tasks in future studies in order to bolster understanding of participants’ experiences of completing these tasks.
