over smaller, sooner ones. The precise cognitive capacities that facilitate
future-oriented choice are still unknown, though. Recent research has
pointed to a link between better declarative memory and reduced
temporal discounting (Bulley & Schacter, 2023; Lempert, MacNear,
et al., 2020; Lempert, Mechanic-Hamilton, et al., 2020), but this work
has focused primarily on episodic memory. Here we tested the novel
hypothesis that better semantic memory ability is associated with lower

temporal discounting.
Temporal discounting is typically measured by having participants
make a series of choices between smaller, sooner monetary rewards (e.
g., “$10 today”) and larger, later monetary rewards (e.g., “$25 in 14
days”). From these choices, a discount rate can be derived. Higher dis­
count rates reflect a tendency to choose immediate rewards at one’s
long-term expense, whereas lower discount rates reflect more patience.
Discount rates measured in the laboratory are associated with many
real-world behaviors that have delayed consequences (Bartels et al.,
2023; Bradford et al., 2017; Chabris et al., 2008). For example, people
with higher discount rates are more likely to smoke (Bickel et al., 1999),
use alcohol (Bradford et al., 2017; Vuchinich & Simpson, 1998), buy
unhealthy foods (Appelhans et al., 2019), gamble (Dixon et al., 2006),
have credit card debt (Meier & Sprenger, 2012), and exercise less
(Bradford et al., 2017). Temporal discounting is also reliably higher in
some forms of psychopathology, such as substance use disorder (Amlung
et al., 2017, 2019; MacKillop et al., 2011). Understanding the cognitive
processes underlying individual differences in temporal discounting will

not only help elucidate the mechanisms by which intertemporal choices
are made; this knowledge can also help us develop interventions for
reducing discounting.
The notion that long-term, declarative memory plays a key role in
temporal discounting is inspired by research showing that the neural
mechanisms of thinking about the future overlap with the neural
mechanisms of episodic memory retrieval (Bulley & Schacter, 2023;
Schacter et al., 2007). Moreover, people who are better able to recollect
the past in detail (i.e., those who have better episodic memory retrieval
ability) have also been shown to imagine the future in more detail (Addis
et al., 2011; Hassabis et al., 2007). Imagining future outcomes more
vividly can enhance the value of those outcomes, perhaps by making
them seem more proximal and concrete (Rick & Loewenstein, 2008;
Trope & Liberman, 2010). Indeed, just having people engage in episodic
future thinking before they make intertemporal choices has been shown
to reduce temporal discounting (Benoit et al., 2011; Peters & Büchel,
2010). This effect has been replicated many times (Rösch et al., 2022),
and other manipulations of temporal discounting have generally been
less successful (Lempert & Phelps, 2016; Rung & Madden, 2018).
If imagining the future can attenuate temporal discounting, and if
people with better episodic memory are better at imagining the future,
then perhaps individual differences in temporal discounting are driven
by individual differences in episodic memory. There is not much evi­
dence for an association between episodic memory and temporal dis­
counting, though. Two studies showed no relationship between episodic
memory and temporal discounting in cognitively normal older adults
(Boyle et al., 2012; Seinstra et al., 2015). Another study found that
standard neuropsychological measures of delayed episodic recall were
associated with temporal discounting in older adults, but this relation­
ship was driven by the subset of participants who were diagnosed with
mild cognitive impairment (Lempert, Mechanic-Hamilton, et al., 2020).
Two studies using Human Connectome Project data (>1000 adult par­
ticipants) did not find significant correlations between episodic memory
scores and temporal discounting (Garzón et al., 2023; Yeh et al., 2021).
Finally, although people with amnesia due to hippocampal damage
show severe episodic memory deficits (Rosenbaum et al., 2005), their
discount rates are no different from those of healthy controls (Craver
et al., 2014; Kwan et al., 2012). It is difficult to argue that episodic
memory is critical for choosing delayed rewards, when people who
cannot form new episodic memories are still capable of choosing
delayed rewards.
One explanation for these null results is that semantic memory, which
remains unimpaired in people with damage restricted to the hippo­
campus, is sufficient for considering the future in decision making. Se­
mantic memory is not entirely distinct from episodic memory; episodic
memories become “semanticized” over time (Renoult et al., 2019;
Sekeres et al., 2018). Semantic memories can be distinguished from
episodic memories, though, because they are not confined to a single
time and place (Tulving, 1987). Rather, semantic memory comprises
categories, concepts, and schemas that are learned over time. Schemas
stored in semantic memory provide the scaffolding for episodic future
thinking (Irish et al., 2012), since imagined future events, no matter how
vividly they can be conjured, lack specific time and place details by
definition. Therefore, if someone is able to draw on semantic knowledge
– that is, knowledge of how things usually are – then they may be able to
make decisions in their long-term best interest, even if they cannot
envision future events in detail.
The strongest evidence for the idea that future-oriented choice de­
pends on semantic memory comes from the neuroscience literature. The
brain region that is most crucial for semantic memory is the anterior
temporal lobe (Lambon Ralph et al., 2012). The anterior temporal lobe is
also the region where cortical thickness is most robustly and uniquely
associated with temporal discounting (Garzón et al., 2023): people with
more intact anterior temporal lobes have lower discount rates.
Furthermore, people who are known to have extensive damage to the
anterior temporal lobe, such as those with semantic variant primary

progressive aphasia (svPPA), do show steep discounting, both compared
to healthy controls and to people with other neurodegenerative diseases
(Beagle et al., 2020; Chiong et al., 2016). The defining feature of svPPA
is a loss of semantic knowledge, but patients with this disorder also have
a severe deficit in prospection (Irish et al., 2012; Irish & Piolino, 2016),
because they lack the schemas needed to imagine events that haven’t
occurred yet. Therefore, it is possible that what enables future-oriented
decision making is conceptual information that is stored in semantic
memory.
To our knowledge, no study has directly examined semantic memory
and temporal discounting in the same set of participants in order to see if
they are associated. We used two measures to assess different aspects of
semantic memory: semantic fluency and the Deese-Roediger-McDermott
(DRM) false memory paradigm. Semantic fluency is a semantic memory
retrieval task that is known to engage the anterior temporal lobe (Baldo
et al., 2006; Poch et al., 2021). In the semantic fluency task (Morris
et al., 1989), participants name as many exemplars as they can from a
category that is provided to them (e.g., animals) in a short amount of
time. The number of unique exemplars named in that time is a measure
of semantic retrieval ability. Of course, semantic fluency is also shaped
by other cognitive processes, such as inhibition, working memory, ver­
bal ability, and processing speed (Unsworth et al., 2011), so finding a
relationship between semantic fluency and temporal discounting does
not provide conclusive evidence that semantic retrieval underlies futureoriented choice. For that reason, we also included a measure of letter
fluency as a control task. In letter fluency, participants name as many
words beginning with a certain letter (e.g., “L”) as they can. Letter
fluency and semantic fluency are highly correlated with each other, and
they both rely on executive functions (Unsworth et al., 2011), but only
semantic fluency requires that participants retrieve meanings of words,
since letter fluency can be performed using phonological cues alone.
Moreover, semantic fluency requires the temporal lobe, while letter
fluency does not (Baldo et al., 2010; Gourovitch et al., 2000; Henry &
Crawford, 2004), and semantic memory retrieval is associated with se­
mantic fluency performance, but not letter fluency performance
(Stolwyk et al., 2015). Therefore, we hypothesized that better semantic
fluency would be associated with lower temporal discounting, even after
controlling for letter fluency.
Semantic fluency is a measure of voluntary semantic retrieval; we
sought convergent evidence for the relationship between semantic
memory and temporal discounting by also examining a measure of
involuntary semantic retrieval: the DRM false memory paradigm. In the
DRM false memory paradigm (Roediger & McDermott, 1995), partici­
pants are first asked to encode a list of words that are drawn from a small
number of categories. Later, they are asked whether they recognize: (1)
previously seen words, (2) words that were strong semantic associates of
the previously seen words, but were not seen at encoding (critical
words), and (3) new words that were unrelated to the encoded words
(distractor words). In this task, people often falsely remember seeing
new words that are strong semantic associates of previously seen words
(Gallo, 2010; Pardilla-Delgado & Payne, 2017). This modulation of
episodic memory by semantic knowledge depends on the anterior tem­
poral lobe (Gallate et al., 2009), and people with better semantic
memory abilities tend to show more false memories for critical lures
(Gatti et al., 2024). Thus, our second measure of semantic memory was
the critical word false alarm rate in the DRM task. If we were to find that
both semantic fluency and the critical word false alarm rate are asso­
ciated with temporal discounting, then that would suggest that the as­
sociation between semantic memory and temporal discounting
generalizes across tasks, and does not depend on semantic retrieval
being voluntary. Since episodic memory ability can also influence the
critical word false alarm rate, here we calculated and controlled for d’ in
our analysis. We also controlled for the criterion, a response bias toward
endorsing words as familiar. We hypothesized that a higher critical word
false alarm rate would be associated with lower temporal discounting,
even after controlling for d’ and criterion.

Just as we included control measures for semantic fluency and false
memory rate in our study, we also included a control decision-making
task, to ensure that any relationships that we found were specific to
intertemporal preferences. Therefore, we also assessed risk tolerance, by
having participants make a series of choices between smaller, certain
and larger, probabilistic rewards (Levy et al., 2010). Risk tolerance re­
flects the extent to which people devalue rewards that are uncertain,
rather than delayed. Since we expect that semantic memory is involved
specifically in considering delayed outcomes, we did not expect to see
any significant relationships between our semantic memory measures
and risk tolerance.
In sum, here we examined semantic memory and decision making in
an online community sample. We hypothesized that better semantic
memory would be associated with reduced temporal discounting.

American Indian or Alaska Native Hispanic, 4 Other/Mixed Race His­
panic, 2 Other/Mixed race non-Hispanic, and 7 Not Reported). Partici­
pants were paid $5 for completing the study (~$10.46 / hour). In
addition, one participant per data collection day (five participants total)
received a bonus based on their choices in the decision-making tasks (see
below for details). All participants gave informed consent, and approval
was obtained from Adelphi University’s Institutional Review Board
(protocol #060323). The research was conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki.
Procedure
Participants performed a series of tasks and surveys in the following
order: Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) encoding task, temporal dis­
counting task, risk tolerance task, semantic fluency, letter fluency, de­
mographic and survey measures, and, finally, a DRM recognition
memory task (Fig. 1). The average time it took to complete the study was
28.68 min (SD = 8.03 min). The study was presented in Qualtrics
(Provo, UT).

Method
Participants
Participants were recruited online via Prolific. A recent meta-analysis
of individual differences research found that a typical correlation effect
size in this literature is about r = 0.2 (Gignac & Szodorai, 2016). To
achieve 80% power to detect a correlation of that size (at α = 0.05), 191
participants are required. To account for exclusions, we adhered to a
data collection stopping rule of 230 participants. To be included, par­
ticipants had to be at least eighteen years of age, fluent in English, and
currently residing in the United States. They were also required to
complete the survey on either their laptops or desktop computers (no
mobile devices). No other inclusion criteria were used. The survey
should have taken approximately 30 min to complete, so participants
were excluded if they took less than 15 min (n = 1) or more than 50 min
(n = 20) to complete it. We excluded participants at these extremes
because we wanted to make sure that the delay time between encoding
and retrieval was similar for all participants. Participants were also
excluded if they failed at least two of four attention check questions in
the decision-making tasks (n = 2 additional participants) or if they did
not follow instructions in the fluency tasks (n = 3). Two of those three
participants attempted to write down words from the encoding list
instead of listing exemplars from categories; the remaining participant
provided a numbered list of more exemplars than it would be possible to
type in just one minute (50, 50, 100, and 98 in each of the four cate­
gories). We decided that this participant must have copy and pasted this
word list from another source (e.g., artificial intelligence). Finally, one
participant was excluded for admitting that they wrote down the words
from the encoding list to study them.
Therefore, a total of 203 participants were included in the study (114
F, 84 M, 3 non-binary, 2 not reported; mean age = 37.2; SD = 12.4;
range: 19–76; 134 White Non-Hispanic, 15 White Hispanic, 9 Asian NonHispanic, 1 Asian Hispanic, 28 Black Non-Hispanic, 2 Black Hispanic, 1

DRM encoding task
Participants viewed a list of 54 words for three seconds each. They
were told ahead of time that they would be tested for their memory of
those words later in the study. These words were drawn from the DRM
lists (Roediger & McDermott, 1995). There were nine words drawn from
six semantic categories (i.e., masculine traits, sleep, sweets, emotions,
insects, and colors; see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 for full word lists).
After three seconds passed, the next word appeared automatically. The
encoding task was split into three blocks of eighteen words each, so that
participants could have a thirty second break between blocks.
Temporal discounting task
Next, participants completed two decision-making tasks. Before the
tasks began, participants were given the following instructions: “Later
today, we will be holding a lottery, which will randomly select one
participant out of every 50 participants and award them with one of the
options they have chosen in one of the two tasks. Each choice has an
equal chance of being selected, so you should respond on each choice as
if it were the one that was going to be paid.” Right before the temporal
discounting task, we added the following: “If, on the choice selected, you
chose money today, you will get that money today as a bonus in Prolific.
If, on the choice selected, you chose a delayed amount of money, you
will get that amount of money as a bonus in Prolific, after the delay has
passed.” In the temporal discounting task (Lempert, MechanicHamilton, et al., 2020; Senecal et al., 2012), participants made 53 de­
cisions. Each question required the participant to choose between two
options: one was an amount of money that the participant could receive
immediately, and the other was an amount of money the participant
could receive after a delay (e.g., $24 now or $25 in 166 days; see

Fig. 1. Procedure timeline. The study was presented in five parts in Qualtrics, and it took about 30 min total.

Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 for full list of choices from both decisionmaking tasks). The task has 51 choices, designed to capture a range of
discount rates. We included an additional two “catch” trials in which we
asked participants whether they wanted more money now or less money
later (“$10 now or $9 in 180 days?” and “$28 now or $26 in 100 days?”).
On these trials, any participant who is paying attention should select the
immediate option since it dominates the delayed option on both attri­
butes − amount and delay.

understand the extent to which people feel like events are within their
control (internal locus of control) or outside of their control (external
locus of control; Rotter, 1966). This questionnaire was included to test a
separate research question, and so, we will not discuss the results
further.
DRM recognition memory task
Finally, participants were tested on their memory for the words that
they saw in the encoding task. They were provided with a list of 54
words, one at a time, and asked whether they recognized each word
from the earlier list. Participants were presented with four options on
each trial: “definitely old,” “probably old,” “definitely new,” and
“probably new.” There was no time constraint given, and participants
would move on to the next trial automatically, as soon as they respon­
ded. Of the 54 words on the list, 18 of those words were from the original
encoding list (“old” words), 18 were not on the list, but were drawn from
the same semantic categories as the words on the encoding list (“critical”
words), and 18 were novel words that were unrelated to any of the
words in the encoding list (“distractor” words).
At the very end of the procedure, participants were asked to indicate
whether or not they had written the words from the encoding list down.
We excluded anyone who admitted to doing so.

Risk tolerance task
Right before the risk tolerance task, participants were once again
reminded about the lottery. The following language was added before
this block: “If, on the choice selected, you chose money for sure, you will
get that money today as a bonus in Prolific. If, on the choice selected,
you chose a gamble option, we will flip a coin to see if you get that
amount of money that you gambled for, or if you get $0. That amount
would also be sent to you today as a bonus in Prolific.” During the risk
tolerance task, participants made 62 choices. On each trial, one option
was an amount of money that the participant could receive for sure (i.e.,
with a 100% chance), and the other option was an amount of money
they could receive with a 50% chance (i.e., the gamble option). If the
gamble option was selected, the participant would have a 50% chance of
getting that amount of money; otherwise, they would receive $0. Two
“catch” trials were included that asked if participants preferred more
money for sure or less money with a 50 % chance (“$13 for sure or $10
with a 50% chance?” and “$21 for sure or $20 with a 50% chance?”). On
these trials, since the lower monetary value was also more uncertain,
any participant who is trying to maximize potential earnings should
select the higher value. Any participants who failed to select the higher
value on two or more of these catch trials – across both decision-making
tasks – was excluded.

Analysis
Decision-making tasks
Participants’ individual choice data for the temporal discounting and
risk tolerance tasks were fit with the following logistic function using
maximum likelihood estimation in MATLAB:
P1 =

Fluency tasks
Next, participants did four fluency tasks. In each task, they were
asked to name as many exemplars from a category as they could in 60 s
(the task would automatically end after 60 s). The first two tasks were
semantic fluency tasks; participants were asked to name as many ani­
mals as they could, and then as many vegetables as they could. The next
two were letter fluency tasks; participants were asked to name as many
words beginning with the letter “F,” as they could, and then as many “L”
words as they could. The number of unique exemplars that fit into the
category was taken as a measure of fluency. Plural forms of nouns and
different conjugations of verbs were accepted, however. Misspellings
were allowed as long as the meaning of the word was clear. The number
of animals and vegetables named were added together to create a se­
mantic fluency score, and the number of F-words and L-words were
summed to determine the letter fluency score.

, P2 = 1 − P1

Here P1 refers to the probability that the participant chose option 1, and
P2 refers to the probability that the participant chose option 2. SV1 and
SV2 refer to the participant’s estimated subjective value of option 1 and
option 2 respectively. The scaling factor β was fitted for each individual
task.
In the temporal discounting task, P1 was the probability of choosing
the delayed option, and the subjective values of the options were esti­
mated using a hyperbolic discounting function (Green & Myerson, 2004;
Kable & Glimcher, 2007; Mazur, 1987):
SV =

A
1 + kD

(2)

Here A is the amount received, D is the delay until receipt (for immediate
rewards, D = 0), and k is a discount rate parameter that varies across
subjects. Higher k indicates higher discounting (more impatience). Since
k is not normally distributed, these values were natural log-transformed
before statistical analyses were conducted. The log-transformed dis­
count rate parameter k was our measure of temporal discounting.
In the risk tolerance task, P1 was the probability of choosing the risky
option. SV1 and SV2 (for the risky option and safe option, respectively)
were estimated using a power utility function:

Demographic and survey measures
Participants were next asked about their age, religion, race,
ethnicity, occupation, place of residence, socioeconomic status, income,
and political orientation. Income took on one of three values: 1 (corre­
sponding to < $52k/year), 2 (corresponding to >$52k/year, but
<$156k/year, or middle-class), or 3 (corresponding to >$156k/year).
Participants were also asked to report their “subjective” socioeconomic
status, by rating where they stood on a metaphorical ladder. This mea­
sure is known as the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status (Adler
et al., 2000). Participants were instructed as follows: “Imagine that this
ladder is a representation of how the United States of America is set up.
At the top of the ladder are the people who are the best off, those who
have the most money, most education, and best jobs. At the bottom are
the people who are the worst off, those who have the least money, least
education, worst jobs, or no job.” Participants then entered a numerical
value ranging from 1 (top of the ladder) to 10 (bottom of the ladder).
After the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status, participants
did the Rotter Locus of Control questionnaire. This questionnaire aims to

SV = p*Aα

(3)

Here A is the amount that could be received, p is the probability of
receipt (p = .5 for the risky option, p = 1 for the certain option), and α is
a risk tolerance parameter that varies across subjects. Higher α indicates
greater risk tolerance (less risk aversion). The values of α were also
natural log-transformed before statistical analyses were conducted.
Fluency analyses
We took a hierarchical regression approach to analyze our data, with
the log-transformed discount rate as the dependent variable. In the first
step, we entered demographic variables which may have an impact on
4

D. Akilov and K.M. Lempert

temporal discounting: age, gender, years of education, income level, and
subjective socioeconomic status. Gender and income level were entered
as factor variables, rather than continuous variables, with three levels
each. For gender, the levels were male, female, and other; the “other”
category comprised individuals who identified as non-binary or third
gender (n = 3), or who did not report their gender (n = 2; note that we
did not have enough power to investigate these categories separately).
For income level, the three levels were: <$52,000/year, between
$52,000 and $156,000/year, and >$156,000/year. In the second step,
we entered letter fluency (sum of F-words and L-words), thus controlling
for any effects of processing speed, executive function, or verbal ability
on temporal discounting. Finally, the semantic fluency score (sum of
animals and vegetables named) was entered in the third step. We hy­
pothesized that better semantic fluency would be associated with lower
temporal discounting. To ensure that this relationship, if significant, was
specific to temporal discounting, we re-ran this regression with risk
tolerance as the dependent variable.

word false alarm rate was entered in the third step. We expected that the
critical word false alarm rate would be negatively associated with
temporal discounting. We also ran this regression again with risk
tolerance score as the dependent variable, to verify that any relation­
ships we found were specific to temporal discounting. We set an α level
of 0.05 for significance testing for all analyses.
Results
Descriptive statistics and inter-item reliability estimates for all
measures are shown in Table 1, and bivariate Pearson correlations
among our measures are shown in Table 2.
In line with our first hypothesis, semantic fluency was negatively
associated with temporal discounting. Semantic fluency significantly
predicted temporal discounting above and beyond the effects of age,
gender, education, income, subjective socioeconomic status, and letter
fluency (standardized β = -0.269; 95 % CI: − 0.440 – − 0.096; p = 0.002;
R2 = 0.107; ΔR2 = 0.044; Table 3). That is, participants who named
more unique animals and vegetables when prompted to do so were more
likely to select larger, later rewards over smaller, sooner ones. A scat­
terplot illustrating the bivariate correlation between semantic fluency
and temporal discounting is shown in Fig. 2. Demonstrating the speci­
ficity of this association to intertemporal decision making, semantic
fluency was not associated with risk tolerance (standardized β = -0.064;
95 % CI: − 0.239 – 0.112; p = 0.477; R2 = 0.068; ΔR2 = 0.002; Sup­
plementary Table 5).
Turning to the recognition task results, participants performed
significantly above chance on the DRM task (mean d’ = 2.04; SD = 1.23;
t202 = 23.7; p < 0.001; Cohen’s d = 1.66). They falsely recalled the
critical words (i.e., strong associates of the encoded words) at a rate of
46.8 % on average. Unsurprisingly, given the large literature on false
memory in the DRM paradigm, people were more likely to mistakenly
recognize a critical word rather than a distractor word (t202 = 20.1; p <
0.001; Cohen’s dz = 1.41).
Contrary to our second hypothesis, however, the critical word false
alarm rate was not associated with temporal discounting (standardized
β = -0.053; 95 % CI: − 0.225 – 0.118; p = 0.543; R2 = 0.096; ΔR2 =
0.002; Table 4). Therefore, the extent to which semantic knowledge
influences episodic memory retrieval in the DRM task does not predict
people’s intertemporal preferences. False memory rate was also not
associated with risk tolerance (standardized β = 0.035; 95 % CI: − 0.134
– 0.205; p = 0.680; R2 = 0.119; ΔR2 = 0.0008; Supplementary Table 6).

False memory analyses
For the analysis of the recognition memory task, all responses of
either “definitely old” or “probably old” were labeled as “yes” responses,
and all responses of either “definitely new” or “probably new” were
considered “no” responses. If a word had appeared in the encoding task,
and the participant indicated that they saw it, that trial was labeled as a
“hit,” and the participant’s hit rate was defined as the percentage of
times that they answered “yes,” to seeing a word from the encoding task.
The novel words were divided into those that were strong semantic as­
sociates of words that appeared in the encoding task (“critical words”)
and those that were drawn from categories that never appeared in the
encoding task (“distractor words”). If a participant responded that they
saw one of the novel words before, then that was considered a false
alarm. False alarm rates were computed separately for the critical words
and the distractor words. We conducted a paired-samples t-test to
compare each participant’s distractor word false alarm rate to their
critical word false alarm rate. We expected that the false alarm rate
would be higher for the critical words compared to the distractor words,
in line with previous research.
The critical word false alarm rate was our measure of semantic
memory from this task. Of course, the critical word false alarm rate may
also reflect episodic memory ability. Therefore, we planned to include a
d’ measure as a covariate. The d′ measure was calculated as z-score (hit
rate) – z-score (distractor word false alarm rate). We implemented
standard correction procedures to account for hit rates of 1 and false
alarm rates of 0, by adjusting extreme values by 1/2N, where N is the
number of old words for hit rates and the number of novel foils for false
alarms. We ensured that participants performed above chance on the
episodic memory task, by conducting a one-sample t-test to compare d’
to 0. In addition to calculating d’, we also calculated the criterion, as
defined by − .5*(z-score (hit rate) + z-score (distractor word false alarm
rate). Controlling for this measure of response bias is important, since
the extent to which someone is biased toward endorsing a word as “old”
can also impact the false memory rate.
We took a similar hierarchical regression approach to examine the
relationship between false memory rate and temporal discounting. In
the first step, we entered age, gender, years of education, income level,
and subjective socioeconomic status. In the second step, we entered d’,
criterion, and the total task duration in seconds. These variables repre­
sent non-semantic influences on false memory: d’ and criterion are
measures of episodic memory accuracy and response bias, respectively,
and task duration is a proxy for the time delay that separated the
encoding task and the recognition memory task. While the delay was set
to be approximately 20 min for all participants, it did vary somewhat
between subjects since the decision-making tasks and demographic
surveys were self-paced. Since the encoding task was the same length for
all participants, the total task duration was directly proportional to the
length of the delay between encoding and retrieval. Finally, the critical

tested the novel hypothesis that semantic memory abilities are associ­
ated with reduced temporal discounting. To this end, we examined in­
dividual differences in semantic fluency and DRM false memory rate and
related them to individual differences in temporal discounting. We
found that semantic fluency, a measure of voluntary semantic memory
retrieval, was negatively associated with temporal discounting. Specif­
ically, participants who generated more category exemplars in the se­
mantic fluency task were more likely to select larger, later rewards over
smaller, sooner rewards. In contrast, the false memory rate, which

measures the extent to which semantic knowledge incidentally biases
episodic memory, was not associated with temporal discounting.
This study has a few noteworthy limitations. First of all, we used a
correlational design. Therefore, we do not know whether semantic
memory influences temporal discounting, or vice versa. It is also possible
that a third, latent variable is related to both constructs. Nevertheless,
demonstrating this association is an important step in understanding the
cognitive mechanisms underlying temporal discounting. Another limi­
tation is that our study was done online, which gave us less experimental

fluency both assess executive functions, such as processing speed,
working memory, and cognitive flexibility (Unsworth et al., 2011), but
semantic fluency relies on semantic memory much more than letter
fluency does (Stolwyk et al., 2015). If we had found a significant asso­
ciation between both types of fluency and temporal discounting, then we
would not have known which of the many cognitive processes captured
by both tasks is associated with temporal discounting. That relationship
might have been driven by executive function, conscientiousness,
attention, or even just general intelligence. The dissociation between
letter fluency and semantic fluency thus strengthens our conclusions visà-vis semantic memory and temporal discounting.
On the other hand, a different measure of semantic memory – the
false memory rate from the DRM paradigm (Roediger & McDermott,
1995) – was not associated with temporal discounting. One possible
explanation for this null result is that only voluntary semantic memory
retrieval – which is assessed by the semantic fluency task but not by the
DRM paradigm – is important for intertemporal decision making. In our
sample, the critical word false alarm rate was not even associated with
semantic fluency (r = -0.11; p = 0.118), so despite the fact that semantic
processes are involved in both tasks, the tasks are clearly not measuring
the same construct. Future studies using additional semantic memory
tasks (e.g., semantic priming; Gatti et al., 2024) are needed to further
understand the precise mechanism by which semantic memory supports
future-oriented choice.
In sum, here we directly tested whether measures of semantic
memory are associated with temporal discounting. Semantic fluency, a
measure of voluntary semantic memory retrieval, was associated with
more future-oriented choice. The DRM false memory rate, a measure of
the extent to which semantic knowledge incidentally biases episodic
memory, was not. Semantic memory is necessary for imagining the
future (Irish et al., 2012; Irish & Piolino, 2016); our finding suggests that
it may be critical for the valuation of future rewards as well.

Fig. 2. Scatterplot illustrating significant Pearson correlation between seman­
tic fluency and temporal discounting. Note that the primary analysis was a
hierarchical regression in which demographic variables were controlled for in a
first step, and letter fluency was controlled for in a second step. Semantic
fluency was quantified as the total number of animal and vegetable exemplars
provided in the semantic fluency tasks. Discount rates were log-transformed
prior to analysis.

control. We excluded people who showed evidence of cheating on the
tasks, but some participants who used artificial intelligence or other aids
might have escaped detection. There was also some variability between
participants in how long the delay between encoding and retrieval was,
although we did try to control for that in our models. A strength of our
online study is that it allowed us to collect a large sample size, which was
necessary, given that most effect sizes from individual differences ana­
lyses are small (Gignac & Szodorai, 2016). It also allowed us to collect a
sample that was diverse with respect to age, geographical location, in­
come, and education. Still, we hope that future research will replicate
this effect in different samples and settings. Finally, it is a limitation that
we did not pre-register the hypotheses and analyses used in this study.
However, we have been transparent here about our hypotheses, and we
did establish our exclusion criteria and stopping rule for data collection
before we collected data.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that semantic
memory abilities are associated with temporal discounting in a general
population. Episodic future thinking has been shown to reduce temporal
discounting (Rösch et al., 2022). This discovery prompted several pre­
vious studies to examine the links between episodic memory – a key
contributor to episodic future thinking – and temporal discounting, but
these studies have been inconclusive (Boyle et al., 2012; Garzón et al.,
2023; Lempert, MacNear, et al., 2020; Lempert, Mechanic-Hamilton,
et al., 2020; Seinstra et al., 2015). Imagining the future and making
decisions about it may actually depend more on semantic memory than
on episodic memory, though. Semantic memory provides the “scaf­
folding” for prospection (Irish et al., 2012), since it is where schemas and
scripts are drawn from. Indeed, previous neuroscience research has
shown that semantic memory deficits and atrophy in the temporal lobe
are associated with increased temporal discounting (Beagle et al., 2020;
Chiong et al., 2016; Garzón et al., 2023; Owens et al., 2017).
Although our study was correlational, the semantic fluency result
suggests that individual differences in temporal discounting may emerge
from individual differences in the ability to retrieve conceptual infor­
mation, including conceptual information about the future. This puta­
tive mechanism is further supported by the specificity of the association
that we found. First of all, semantic fluency was not related to risk
preferences, in line with the idea that semantic memory is involved
specifically in deciding about future rewards. Second, semantic fluency
predicted significant variance in temporal discounting even after ac­
counting for effects of letter fluency. In fact, letter fluency alone did not
significantly predict temporal discounting. Letter fluency and semantic
