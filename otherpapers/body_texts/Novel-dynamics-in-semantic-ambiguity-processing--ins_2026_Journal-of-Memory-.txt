Introduction
A persistent question in psycholinguistic research is how semantic
factors influence the reading process. In this respect, one prominent line
of investigation has come to focus on semantic ambiguity, examining
how multiple interpretations of ambiguous words affect response times.
Many early studies on semantic ambiguity did not distinguish between
polysemous words, which have multiple related senses (e.g., twist: “twist
one’s ankle” vs. “a twist in a story”), and homonymous words, which
have distinct and unrelated meanings (e.g., bank: “financial institution”
vs. “side of a river”) (e.g., Gottlob et al., 1999; Hino & Lupker, 1996;
Hino et al., 1998; Jastrzembski, 1981; Kellas et al., 1988; Lichacz et al.,
1999; Millis & Button, 1989; Rubenstein et al., 1970). The mainstay of
those studies is the “ambiguity advantage”, the observation that
ambiguous words, including polysemes and homonyms, were processed
faster than words with fewer interpretations (e.g., food, tent) across

tasks, such as lexical decision and naming. Subsequent research began to
recognize and explore the distinction between polysemes and hom­
onyms, revealing more nuanced processing patterns for the two word
types. In lexical decision research, polysemous words generally show a
processing advantage (i.e., faster reaction times, sometimes accompa­
nied by lower error rates) compared to unambiguous controls, whereas
homonyms are either processed like unambiguous controls or show
disadvantages (higher latencies and error rates) (Beretta et al., 2005;
Klepousniotou & Baum, 2007; Klepousniotou et al., 2008; Locker et al.,
2003; Rodd et al., 2002; 2004).
In semantic categorization tasks, the results differ slightly. No
polysemy advantage is observed; however, homonyms show a process­
ing time disadvantage when decisions are relatively difficult, such as
when participants have to determine whether a given word (e.g., bank,
bark) belongs to a large semantic category (e.g., man-made objects).
When semantic categorization involves a narrow and well-defined

category (e.g., vegetables or animals), no processing disadvantage is
observed (Forster, 2004; Hino et al., 2006).
Several models have been proposed to explain the effects of semantic
ambiguity, following two notable approaches. The first is a con­
nectionist approach with different instantiations. For example, the
Attractor Network Model (Rodd et al., 2004), explains how the mental
lexicon processes semantic ambiguity by structuring representations
based on relatedness. For polysemous words with related senses (e.g.,
twist), the model posits broader, unified attractor basins that enable
shallow activation states and facilitate quick recognition. Homonymous
words (e.g., bank, bark) with unrelated meanings occupy deeper and
narrower basins, leading to competition and slower processing. Another
connectionist model, the Semantic Settling Dynamics (SSD) model
(Armstrong & Plaut, 2008, 2016), extends this approach by focusing on
temporal dynamics. The SSD highlights how polysemous word senses
cooperate early in processing, offering an advantage, whereas homon­
ymous meanings compete, and show a disadvantage, particularly at later
processing stages. This model also links these effects to task-specific
factors, such as difficulty in distinguishing nonwords or degraded
stimuli, showing how such conditions can amplify the processing dy­
namics of ambiguity.
The second approach is theory-driven and outlined in the Response
Configuration Model (Hino et al., 2006). This model challenges the
connectionist perspective by attributing ambiguity effects to taskdependent response selection rather than differences in semantic rep­
resentations. On this account, all semantic meanings of a word are
activated; however, task demands influence how the response system
resolves these activations. For example, categorizing a polysemous word
such as paper into a broad category (e.g., non-living thing) is easier
because its related senses align, simplifying response selection. In
contrast, homonyms such as bank, with unrelated meanings, create
conflicting activations, complicate categorization tasks, and lead to a
processing disadvantage. This model underscores how the cognitive
system adapts its response strategies to semantic and task contexts, of­
fering a distinct perspective on the effects of ambiguity.
A key shared feature of these models is the assumption that meaning
resolution occurs after lexical access to whole-word forms, a view well
suited to morphologically simple words (e.g., bank, bark, twist) in IndoEuropean languages. In contrast, in Arabic, words are systematically
decomposed into roots and word patterns before lexical access
(Boudelaa & Marslen-Wilson, 2005; Boudelaa et al., 2023; Boudelaa
et al., 2024; Boudelaa et al., 2025; Perea et al., 2010; Prunet and Béland,
2000; Saiegh-Haddad, 2003). This decomposition stage may shape the
ambiguity resolution process itself: polysemous words may benefit from
shared root activation that facilitates integration, whereas homonyms
may experience an early advantage followed by a late disadvantage
owing to the divergent meanings conveyed by the same root. Investi­
gating ambiguity in Arabic offers a unique opportunity to test how
morphological structure modulates the dynamics of semantic processing
and whether current ambiguity resolution models can be generalized to
morphologically complex languages.
In the remainder of this study, we first introduce semantic ambiguity
in Arabic, highlighting the interaction between morphological and se­
mantic knowledge. Then, we outline the key experimental consider­
ations that motivated our use of lexical decision and semantic
categorization tasks. We follow by presenting five experiments that
systematically examine how Arabic morphological structure modulates
the processing of polysemous and homonymous words. Three lexical
decision experiments assessed early-stage decomposition effects,
whereas two semantic categorization experiments examined meaning
integration. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical implica­
tions of our findings for ambiguity resolution models.

consonantal roots, which carry core semantic content, and word pat­
terns, which provide phonological and grammatical structure (Boudelaa
& Marslen-Wilson, 2015; Boudelaa et al., 2024). For example, the word
jalas”1 consists of the root {jls}, meaning to “sit down,” and the“ ‫ﺟﻠﺲ‬
word pattern {CaCaC}, which defines its phonological structure as
consonant–vowel sequence stressed on the first syllable, with the
morpho-syntactic functions of perfective, active, singular verb (Boudelaa &
Marslen-Wilson, 2005; Boudelaa et al., 2024; Saiegh-Haddad & HenkinRoitfarb, 2014). Roots combine with different patterns to produce
numerous surface forms, which may be unambiguous, polysemous, or
homonymous. For instance, the root {jls} can combine with the pattern
{CaCyC} to form the polysemous word “jalys,” which has multiple
related senses: “associate,” “companion,” “comrade,” “friend,” and “per­
son with whom someone sits.” The root {dqq} can also be combined with
the same pattern {CaCyC} to produce the homonymous word “daqyq,”
which has multiple unrelated meanings: “critical,” “punctual,” “deli­
cate,” “subtle,” “small,” “flour,” and “careful.”.
This taxonomy of Arabic words as consisting of root morphemes
interleaved with word pattern morphemes, is supported by evidence
from behavioral, imaging, and neuropsychological research (Boudelaa
& Marslen-Wilson, 2004, 2005, 2011, 2015; Boudelaa et al., 2019; Frost,
2012; Frost et al., 1997; Seghier & Boudelaa, 2024; Boudelaa et al.,
2025). Overt priming (e.g., cross-modal, and auditory-auditory) and
covert priming (masked priming) techniques provide ample evidence
that word pairs sharing a root morpheme significantly facilitate each
other. When two words share a root, significant priming is observed,
regardless of whether they share a transparent semantic relationship (e.
g., “maktab”- “kitAb” office-book) or an opaque semantic relationship (e.
g., “maktab”- “katybah” office-squadron) (Boudelaa & Marslen-Wilson,
2005, 2015; see also Frost et al., for similar results in Hebrew e.g.,
Frost et al., 1997; Frost et al., 2000). Similarly, words sharing a pattern
(e.g., “xaraja”- “jalasa” go out-sit down) significantly prime each other in
overt and covert priming tasks (Boudelaa & Marslen-Wilson, 2004,
2005, 2011). Neuroimaging and neuropsychological research corrobo­
rate the prominent role of morphological units in Semitic languages. For
example, Gwilliam and Marantz (2015) used magnetoencephalography
to show that root predictability correlates with neural activity in supe­
rior temporal regions, and that pseudo-words violating the Obligatory
Contour Principle2 constraint (e.g., qaqara) were easier to reject as valid
words than frequency-matched counterparts (e.g., vadaha). Similarly,
neuropsychological research suggests that speakers of Semitic languages
can show selective impairment of either roots (Boudelaa et al., 2023;
Prunet and Béland, 2000), or word patterns (Barkai, 1980).
Beyond their prominent role in word recognition, morphological
units, especially roots, affect processing early. Boudelaa and MarslenWilson (2005) examined the timing of morphological effects in Arabic
word recognition using masked priming across multiple stimulus-onset
asynchronies (SOAs). They found that root morpheme effects emerged
as early as SOA 32 ms and persisted across all tested SOAs (up to 80 ms).
In contrast, word pattern effects appeared later, were transient and
detectable only at SOAs of 48 and 64 ms. On the other hand, ortho­
graphic and semantic priming effects occurred only at the longest SOA

Throughout this work, we will primarily use the Buckwalter transliteration
system in quotes to represent Arabic words and morphemes in Latin script for
clarity and consistency. Braces will be used to indicate morphemes (i.e., root
and word pattern), and within word patterns, we will use the letter ‘C’ as a
placeholder for root consonants. Buckwalter’s scheme is available here: https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckwalter_transliteration. In cases where precise pho­
netic detail is necessary, we will provide International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)
transcriptions in /slashes/. However, in order to minimize typesetting com­
plications, IPA will be used only when the Buckwalter transliteration is insuf­
ficient for disambiguation.

nant repetition in Semitic roots (McCarthy, 1981).

(80 ms). These results underscore the early and sustained influence of
roots on Arabic visual processing, separating them from the later,
transient effects of form or meaning relationships. Boudelaa et al.,
(2010) reached a similar conclusion for the auditory modality, extend­
ing evidence for the early prominence of root morphemes. Using
mismatch negativity (MMN) responses, they found that root effects
emerged 160 ms after the deviation point, marked by early and bilateral
fronto-central activation. In contrast, the word pattern effects appeared
later, at 250 ms, with a left-lateralized topography. These findings
confirm the early and dominant role of the root in the auditory domain,
underscoring its central function in Arabic language processing across
modalities.
Based on this, Boudelaa (2014) and Boudelaa and Marslen-Wilson
(2015) proposed the Obligatory Morphological Decomposition (OMD)
model, in which the comprehension of Arabic words, both written and
spoken, is mediated by processes that segment roots and word patterns
to access the lexicon. Importantly, roots and patterns are segmented
both in fully transparent, semantically combinatorial words such as
“katab” write, where the overall meaning revolves around the root’s
general sense of writing, and in semantically non-combinatorial words
like “katybah” squadron, where surface meaning departs significantly
from the core meaning of the root. To recover the idiosyncratic meaning
of “katybah”-type words, the OMD posits a recombination stage after
initial obligatory decomposition (cf., Rastle & Davis, 2008; Taft, 2004).
Extensive evidence for obligatory morphological decomposition in
Arabic, particularly the early and sustained roles of roots and word
patterns in lexical access, raises important questions regarding how
these processes interact with semantic ambiguity. Because roots and
patterns are automatically segmented even in semantically opaque
words, morphological complexity likely shapes the processing of poly­
semy and homonymy. This form-meaning interplay is absent in IndoEuropean languages, where ambiguity resolution operates on morpho­
logically simple words. Thus, while prior models of semantic ambiguity
focused on how multiple meanings compete or cooperate during lexical
access, Arabic presents a unique case where ambiguity resolution occurs
alongside (and may be constrained by) morphological decomposition.
To address these issues, we investigated whether Arabic polysemes
and homonyms diverge in their reliance on morphological decomposi­
tion during meaning resolution. Specifically, do shared roots unify
polysemous senses to facilitate processing, while homonyms, despite
their shared morphology, trigger competition among unrelated mean­
ings? Task demands are equally critical: Does semantic categorization,
which hinges on recombination, amplify the homonym disadvantage
compared with lexical decision that may tap onto early root extraction
processes? Our experiments dissect these dynamics by manipulating (1)
ambiguity type (polysemy vs. homonymy) and (2) task requirements
(lexical decision vs. semantic categorization), offering the first system­
atic test of how morphological and semantic forces interact in Semitic
language ambiguity resolution.
If root extraction facilitates lexical access, as predicted by OMD, we
expect both polysemous and homonymous words to show a processing
advantage in tasks emphasizing early decomposition, such as lexical
decision. Both word types activate shared root morphemes, providing a
rapid route to the lexicon. However, in tasks requiring semantic inte­
gration, such as semantic categorization, diverging patterns may be
expected: polysemous words should maintain an advantage through
cooperative activation of related senses, whereas homonymous words
may be disadvantaged by competition among unrelated meanings dur­
ing recombination.

aligned with the distinct stages of lexical access and semantic integra­
tion central to ambiguity resolution (Balota & Yap, 2011; Forster, 2004;
Goh et al., 2016; Hino et al., 2002; Kinoshita & Norris, 2012a,b; Rastle &
Coltheart, 2010; Rodd et al., 2004). Lexical decision tasks are method­
ological cornerstones for establishing morphological decomposition in
Semitic languages, such as Hebrew and Arabic, with a particular
strength in detecting the early stages of word recognition processes
(Boudelaa et al., 2023, Boudelaa et al., 2025; Perea et al., 2010; Frost
et al., 1997). As seen above, masked priming and neurophysiological
studies demonstrate that Arabic root morphemes are accessed rapidly
and obligatorily, with effects observable as early as 32 ms after prime
word offset. This temporal resolution makes lexical decisions ideal for
examining how the polysemy-homonymy distinction interacts with
morphological decomposition. Thus the lexical decision task allows us to
test whether polysemous words benefit from early root activation,
facilitating lexical access through a shared semantic core, while hom­
onyms trigger competition due to their divergent meanings despite
shared morphology. These questions connect directly to connectionist
models, such as the Semantic Settling Dynamics model, which links
early activation patterns to semantic cohesion among word senses. We
further leverage this task by systematically varying nonword difficulty
to test whether ambiguity effects persist when morphological parsing is
strained by increasingly word-like distractors.
While lexical decision captures early morpho-lexical processing, se­
mantic categorization offers an equally crucial view of later meaning
integration, where task demands guide interpretation. Semantic cate­
gorization requires full semantic resolution, making it particularly use­
ful for assessing leading models of ambiguity resolution such as the
Response Configuration Model (Hino et al., 2006). Research shows that
semantic categorization reveals distinct processing patterns for hom­
onyms versus polysemes, depending on category characteristics. Broad
categories exacerbate the homonym-disadvantage by activating
competing senses, whereas narrow categories constrain interpretations
and reduce this effect (Forster, 2006; Hino et al., 2006). In the Arabic
context, semantic categorization is valuable for testing how the recom­
bination processes proposed by the Obligatory Morphological Decom­
position model operate under semantic pressure. This task tests whether
successful semantic integration depends on the alignment between
decomposed morphological structures and category membership.
In summary, the lexical decision task isolates early decomposition
effects and allows the examination of how semantic ambiguity interacts
with morphological processing, whereas semantic categorization reveals
how ambiguity resolution is shaped by interpretive constraints during
meaning integration. This dual approach systematically tests whether
Arabic polysemes and homonyms diverge in their initial activation dy­
namics and final semantic outcomes. By capturing the full trajectory
from morphological decomposition to semantic decision making, this
methodological combination extends our understanding of ambiguity
resolution beyond Indo-European languages and enriches crosslinguistic models of lexical access through the unique morphological
architecture of Arabic.

Experimental considerations

Experiment 1: Lexical decision with nonwords based on nonexistent roots

To investigate how Arabic morphological structure modulates se­
mantic ambiguity, we used two complementary experimental para­
digms: lexical decisions and semantic categorization. These tasks are
methodologically well established in psycholinguistics and theoretically

The first experiment used a lexical decision task with nonwords
created by altering one or two root letters of real Arabic words (e.g.,
3

maktab becomes majtab and safynah becomes jatynah). These nonwords
lack valid roots and are straightforward to reject, thus the task primarily
taps onto the early decomposition stage of word recognition. Accord­
ingly, two processing consequences are expected: First, root extraction
processes should apply to polysemous and homonymous words, yielding
a semantic ambiguity advantage for both word types compared with
unambiguous words. Second, the recombination stage, during which
specific semantic interpretations are identified, may not have had
enough time to begin; therefore, the multiple unrelated meanings of
homonyms (e.g., “daqyq” flour and precise) would not yet compete.
Conversely, if the recombination is immediate and unrelated meanings
begin competing early, we may observe a relatedness advantage with
polysemes showing faster latencies than homonyms.

OLD20 (Orthographic Levenshtein Distance 20) quantifies orthographic
similarity as the average Levenshtein distance between a target word
and its 20 nearest orthographic neighbors (Yarkoni et al., 2008).
Statistical comparisons of the variables in Table 1 using Tukey’s HSD
tests with FDR correction showed significant differences among
ambiguity-related measures (NMD, NSD, CDoMWE, RoMHR), but not
among control variables such as Nol, NoS, and OLD20 (all FDR corrected
p-values > 0.05; see Supplementary Table S1 for details).
Familiarity of Senses and Meanings: To assess familiarity with the
meanings of homonyms and the senses of polysemes, we conducted a
rating pretest on 340-item list. This list included the two most frequently
suggested homonym meanings, polyseme senses, and unambiguous
words, along with an additional 170 foils. Fifteen participants took part
in the pre-test. They rated the familiarity of word meanings and senses
on a 7-point scale, where 1 indicated very unfamiliar and 7 indicated very
familiar. Semantically ambiguous words were presented once for each
interpretation, with a gloss to clarify the intended meaning. For
example, the Arabic word ‫“( ﺩﻗﻴﻖ‬daqyq”) was shown twice: once labeled
as flour and once as precise, and participants rated each version sepa­
rately. Unambiguous words and foils were presented once without
additional context. The results of this test are summarized in Table 2.
Imageability of Senses and Meanings: We used the same approach as in
the familiarity pretest. All word types (i.e., polysemes, homonyms, and
unambiguous) and 170 foils were pre-tested for imageability by asking
30 new participants to evaluate each meaning/sense on a 7-point scale,
where 1 indicated not at all easy to visualize and 7 indicating very easy to
visualize. This approach quantified the concreteness of each meaning/
sense, measuring how readily participants formed mental images of the
experimental items. As shown in Table 2, which presents familiarity and
imageability results, the experimental words were well matched on
these characteristics. Statistical comparisons of the lexical characteris­
tics in Table 2 using Tukey’s HSD tests with FDR correction revealed no
significant differences in familiarity or imageability between any of the
compared senses or meanings (all FDR-corrected p > 0.05; see Supple­
mentary Table S2 for details).
For the purposes of the lexical decision task, 102 nonwords were
created by altering one or two root letters of existing Arabic words. This
follows standard practices in Semitic languages research, where non­
words are designed to maintain realistic morphological patterns while
ensuring that their roots do not exist in the language. For example, the
word ‫“( ﻭﺍﺣﺪﺓ‬wAHdp,” one) was transformed into the nonword ‫ﺑﺎﺣﺪﺓ‬
(“bAHdp”) by changing one root letter, and the word ‫“( ﺭﻓﺎﻫﺔ‬rfAhp,”
comfort) was modified into the nonword ‫“( ﺭﻧﺎﺛﺔ‬rnAvp”) by changing two
root letters. These nonwords conform to the phonotactic and orthotactic
rules of the language, and participants can quickly identify them as such
because of the absence of meaningful roots, making them a good starting

Method
Participants
Fifty undergraduate students from Alexandria University, Egypt
participated in this experiment voluntarily or for course credit. This
yielded 1,700 observations per condition, consistent with the recom­
mendation of Brysbaert and Stevens (2018) for lexical-decision experi­
ments. All participants were adults with normal (or corrected-tonormal) vision and reported no reading or learning disorders. All par­
ticipants provided informed consent.
Stimuli
One hundred and two non-homographic Arabic words (82 nouns and
20 adjectives) were selected from the Aralex database (Boudelaa &
Marslen-Wilson, 2010) to create three conditions of 34 words each. The
first condition comprised polysemous words with multiple related
senses (e.g., ‫ ﺟﻠﻴﺲ‬associate, a person one sits with, friend; companion;
comrade, sitter); the second consisted of homonyms with multiple un­
related meanings (e.g., ‫ ﺩﻗﻴﻖ‬correct, difficult, excellent, flimsy, flour). The
third condition was made up of unambiguous words without multiple
meanings or senses (e.g., ‫ ﻏﺪﺍﺀ‬lunch). These words were then pre-tested on
the following variables:
Number of Meanings/Senses: We determined the number of meanings
and senses for each word in three complementary ways. First, we relied
on authors’ judgment. Second, we consulted the Modern Arabic Dic­
tionary (almaany.com/). Although this dictionary lists entries under
root morphemes, it distinguishes between multiple senses and multiple
meanings via subheadings. Third, we conducted a semantic pretest. We
compiled 200 items (the 102 experimental words and 98 foils) and asked
30 participants, who did not take part in any of the five experiments, to
write down all the meanings and/or senses each word evoked. A
meaning or sense was counted if at least five participants produced it.
Relatedness Among Meanings/Senses: We assessed relatedness for
polysemes and homonyms using two complementary methods. First, we
administered a similarity-judgment task in which 30 new participants
rated the relatedness of the experimental word pairs intermixed with 24
non-experimental fillers. Participants used a 7-point scale, where 1
indicated “completely unrelated” and 7 indicated “highly related.” This
task captured subjective human judgments of semantic similarity be­
tween word pairs. Second, we calculated the semantic distances among
meanings and senses using word embeddings trained on the entire
Arabic Wikipedia (approximately 350 million tokens). These embed­
dings provide a high-dimensional vector representation, enabling a
quantitative measure of the semantic proximity. Together, the two
methods yielded a reliable convergent distinction between polysemes
and homonyms.
Meaning/Sense Dominance: To establish the dominant meaning/sense
of each ambiguous word, we classified and tallied responses from the
elicitation pretest. For each ambiguous word, any meaning/sense pro­
duced by more than 10% of participants was considered dominant.
Table 1 lists the stimulus characteristics. Orthographic frequency counts
were obtained from ARALEX (Boudelaa & Marslen-Wilson, 2010). The

ing only random intercepts for participants and items (Barr et al., 2013).

Latencies. Our pruning procedure eliminated 250 data points (4.94 %),
of which 4.90 % were errors and 0.04 % outliers, leaving 4848 data
points. We then fitted a linear mixed-effects model (estimated using
REML and the optimx optimizer) to predict log-transformed reaction
times (logRT) based on Word Type, with random intercepts for Target
and Subject. The main effect of Word Type was highly reliable (F(2,

ambiguity effect showed both polysemous words (t(4842) = -7.70, p <

(4842) = -3.58, p < .001, beta = -0.03, 95 % CI [-0.05, − 0.02]) to be
significantly faster than the unambiguous baseline. Finally, the contrast
between polysemous words against homonymous words, testing se­
mantic relatedness, also revealed statistically reliable differences (t

Procedure
Participants were tested either individually or in groups of up to nine
in a normally lit, quiet room. Each participant completed 204 trials (102
words and 102 nonwords) presented in two blocks, with a self-paced
break between blocks. They performed a word–nonword decision task
using a keyboard with two predefined response keys: one for “Word” and
one for “Nonword.” The “Word” response was always assigned to the
dominant hand, typically the right. Stimulus presentation and data
collection were controlled using the DMDX software (Forster & Forster,
2003), with the stimulus display synchronized to the refresh rate of the
screen (16.7 ms). Participants were seated approximately 60 cm away
from the standard computer monitor on which the stimuli were pre­
sented and instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.
Before the experimental trials, they completed 20 practice trials con­
sisting of 10 words and 10 nonwords to familiarize themselves with the
task. The order of stimulus presentation was randomized for each
participant. Each trial began with a fixation point “+” at the center of the
screen for 500 ms, followed by the target for 2000 ms or until response.
The entire experiment lasted for 15–20 min.

Accuracies. A logistic mixed-effects model (estimated using ML and the
Nelder–Mead optimizer) was fitted to predict errors, with Word Type as
a fixed effect and Target and Subject as random effects. Polysemous
words had a significantly lower error rate than the unambiguous con­
dition (z = -3.45, p < .001; beta = -0.62, 95 % CI [-0.98, − 0.27]),
whereas the homonymous words did not (z = -0.783, p = .434). The
difference between polysemes and homonyms was significant (z = 2.69,
p < 0.007, beta = -0.50, 95 % CI [-0.86, − 0.14]).
Discussion

Results
We adopted the following general statistical approach for this and
the subsequent four experiments: reaction time (RT) and accuracy data
were analyzed using linear mixed-effects (LME) models, treating sub­
jects and stimuli as crossed random factors (Baayen, 2008). Analyses
were conducted in R (Version 4.1.3; R Core Team, 2022) using the lme4
package (Version 1.1.35.2; Bates et al., 2018) for model estimation and
the lmerTest (Version 3.1.3; Kuznetsova, Brockhoff, & Christensen,
2017) for hypothesis testing. The fixed effect factor Word Type consisted
of three levels (polysemes, homonyms, and unambiguous) and was
referenced to the unambiguous level. We used R’s default dummy cod­
ing scheme for a number of reasons. First, it offers clear interpretability
since coefficients directly represent differences from the reference
category. Second, it aligns with our research questions and hypothesistesting needs, and avoids the unnecessary complexity of alternative
coding schemes in a non-factorial context. Thus, we created two con­
trasts addressing the effects: “Homonym vs. Unambiguous” and “Poly­
seme vs. Unambiguous” with the reference category “Unambiguous”
coded as 0 in both. For the final contrast “Polyseme vs. Homonym,”
which addresses relatedness effects and is not provided directly by the
model, we used the linear Hypothesis function from the car package
(Version 3.1.2; Fox & Weisberg, 2019). For each contrast, the coefficient
equaled the difference between the beta coefficients of the “Homonym
vs. Unambiguous” and the “Polyseme vs. Unambiguous” contrasts. This
provided chi-square statistics, from which p-values were derived to
determine statistical significance. Standard errors, calculated from the
contrast coefficient and chi-square statistic, were used to compute 95 %
confidence intervals.
In the latency analyses, error trials were excluded, and the RTs were
log-transformed to meet the distributional assumptions of the LME. Cutoff points were set at 100 ms and 2000 ms to minimize data loss. In each
experiment, for both latencies and accuracies, we tested linear mixedeffects models with random slopes and intercepts, simplifying the
structure if they failed to converge or if added complexity did not

Compared to unambiguous baseline words, polysemes showed a
processing advantage of 41 ms, whereas homonyms showed an advan­
tage of 21 ms (Hino et al., 2006, Experiment 1). There was also a 20 ms
processing advantage for polysemes over homonyms. The processing
advantages for both polysemes and homonyms, though counterintuitive
in non-Semitic contexts (Rodd et al., 2004; Armstrong & Plaut, 2016),
can be explained within the linguistic context of Semitic languages,
where root morphemes are the primary units of lexical access. Boudelaa
(2014) and Boudelaa and Marslen-Wilson (2005, 2015) suggested that
lexical access processes in Arabic involve the systematic extraction of
roots, serving as semantic cores, followed by the extraction of word
pattern morphemes that convey phonological and morphosyntactic in­
formation and help converge on the specific target interpretation. On
this view, polysemes and their related senses benefit because root acti­
vation reinforces overlapping conceptual features, leading to efficient
processing. Similarly, despite their unrelated meanings, homonyms
display processing advantages owing to the same root extraction pro­
cess, which prioritizes morphological over semantic disambiguation

during the early stages of word recognition (Boudelaa, 2014; Boudelaa
& Marslen-Wilson, 2015).
The relatedness effect (polysemes being recognized faster than
homonyms) suggests that the recombination stage, in which the root and
word pattern are merged to determine the meaning of idiosyncratic and
ambiguous words, begins immediately after initial morphological
parsing. For homonyms like “daqyq,” where the same root {dqq} maps
onto multiple unrelated meanings (e.g., flour, precise etc.), competition
among meanings seem to begin but does not develop into a full-fledged
process, hence the advantage compared to unambiguous forms and the
disadvantage compared to the polysemes (Boudelaa, 2014; Taft, 2004).
Priming studies support this two-stage approach, showing that
morphological relations activate shared roots regardless of semantic
transparency, while semantic interpretation influences later decisionmaking processes (Boudelaa & Marslen-Wilson, 2005).
Finally, the use of nonwords based on non-existent roots, created by
altering one or two root letters of existing words, promoted rapid re­
sponses and minimized opportunities for the recombination or integra­
tion stage to fully influence processing. This implies that the early stages
of morphological processing mask potential homonym disadvantages
that might otherwise emerge during extended semantic or contextual
evaluation. We tested this possibility in Experiment 2 using pseudoho­
mophones and in Experiment 3 with semantically interpretable non­
words created by illegally combining existing roots and existing word
patterns.

decision, where words from a non-target language slow responses due to
cross-linguistic competition (Dijkstra, Van Jaarsveld & Ten Brinke,
1998).
In standard lexical decision tasks, rapid root extraction from visually
presented words facilitates quick and efficient word recognition, leaving
little opportunity for extended semantic processes. However, when
stimuli include pseudohomophones that differ only minimally in
orthography from real words, participants must engage additional
cognitive processes to distinguish real words from plausible nonwords.
As previous research shows, this orthographic decision-making process
leads to longer response times and more errors as the cognitive system
evaluates and resolves orthographic discrepancies (Briesemeister et al.,
2009; Taha & Khateb, 2013; Martin, 1982). The key question, then, is
whether the anticipated increase in processing time will enable semantic
processing to fully develop, engaging the recombination stage and
revealing an ambiguity advantage for polysemes and an ambiguity
disadvantage for homonyms.
Method
Participants
Fifty-three new undergraduate students from the same population as
in Experiment 1 participated on a voluntary basis or for course credit. All
participants provided informed consent and agreed to participate freely.
Stimuli
The word stimuli were the same 102 items used in Experiment 1: 34
polysemes, 34 homonyms, and 34 unambiguous words. Additionally,
102 pseudohomophones were created from phonological variations
between Standard and Egyptian Arabic. For instance, the Standard
Arabic words ‫ ﺗﻤﺜﻴﻞ‬/tamθi:l/ acting, ‫ ﻣﻘﻔﻮﻝ‬/maqfu:l/ closed, and ‫ ﺳﻄﺮ‬/satʕr /
line were modified to their dialectal counterparts as ‫ ﺗﻤﺴﻴﻞ‬/tamsi:l/, ‫ﻣﺄﻓﻮﻝ‬
/maʔfu:l/, and ‫ ﺻﻄﺮ‬/ sʕatʕr / respectively. The pseudohomophones were
matched to the word stimuli for number of letters (Mean = 4.28, SD =
0.87), syllable count (Mean = 2.07, SD = 0.63), and orthographic
neighborhood density (OLD20; Mean = 1.90, SD = 0.26), ensuring
comparability across the word-nonword stimulus types.

Experiment 2: Lexical decision with pseudohomophones
Experiment 2 tested whether, with sufficient processing time, lexical
dynamics in Arabic would allow semantic recombination processes to
fully unfold, revealing cooperation among related senses and competi­
tion among unrelated word meanings (cf., Armstrong & Plaut, 2016). To
this end, this experiment used pseudohomophones as nonwords (e.g.,
brane for brain). Past research shows that such nonwords slow RT’s and
increase error rates because they create a conflict between the ortho­
graphic representation that does not match any real word and a
phonological representation consistent with an existing word
(Briesemeister et al., 2009; Martin, 1982).
However, a key challenge in adapting the pseudohomophone para­
digm to Arabic is its predominantly consonantal orthography, where
each grapheme is consistently mapped onto a single phoneme. This strict
correspondence makes the alternative spellings used in languages like
English (e.g., brane for brain or peeple for people) impossible. To over­
come this, we exploited the systematic phonological variations between
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and the Egyptian Arabic dialect spoken
by our participants to create the pseudohomophones. Shifts in phoneme
realization in this dialect provide a basis for designing nonwords that are
phonologically identical to real MSA words but are spelled with dialectspecific orthographic deviations.
For example, the MSA voiceless uvular plosive /q/ (as in ‫ﻣﻘﻔﻮﻝ‬
/maqfu:l/, ’closed’) is pronounced as a voiceless glottal stop /ʔ/ (as in
/maʔfu:l/) in Egyptian Arabic. Similarly, the MSA voiceless dental
fricative /θ/ is realized as either a voiceless alveolar stop /t/ (e.g., ‫ﺗﻼﺗﺔ‬
/tala:ta/, ’three’) or a voiceless alveolar fricative /s/ (e.g., ‫ ﺳﺎﻧﻴﺔ‬/sa:nya/,
’second’). We used these predictable shifts to create pseudohomophones
like ‫ ﻣﺄﻓﻮﻝ‬/maʔfu:l/ (from MSA ‫ ﻣﻘﻔﻮﻝ‬/maqfu:l/) and ‫ ﺗﻤﺴﻴﻞ‬/tamsi:l/ (from
MSA ‫ ﺗﻤﺜﻴﻞ‬/tamθi:l/, ’acting’).
In the lexical decision task, this manipulation creates a direct con­
flict. Participants see the dialectal spelling (e.g., ‫ )ﻣﺄﻓﻮﻝ‬but access a
phonological form that matches a real MSA word (/maqfu:l/). To
correctly reject the item as a nonword, they must suppress this activated
MSA lexical representation. This process is akin to bilingual lexical

Procedure
This procedure was identical to Experiment 1, except that partici­
pants were explicitly instructed to classify dialectal spellings as non­
words, accepting only correctly spelled standard Arabic items as valid
words.
Results
In total, 13.13 % of the data were excluded (12.69 % errors and
0.044 % outliers), leaving 4,720 valid data points. The mean response
time in this experiment (Mean = 677.33 ms, SD = 6.77 ms) was
considerably longer than in Experiment 1 (Mean = 575.33 ms, SD =
4.66 ms). The overall error rate (Mean = 12.69 %, SD = 0.32 %) was also
significantly higher than in Experiment 1 (Mean = 4.94 %, SD = 0.21
%). These findings indicate that the use of pseudohomophones as non­
words effectively slowed participants’ responses and elicited a higher
rate of errors. Mean RTs, accuracy rates, ambiguity and relatedness ef­
fects are summarized in Table 4a.
Latencies. A linear mixed-effects model predicting log-transformed re­
action times (logRT) by Word Type, with random intercepts for Target
and Subject, revealed a significant main effect of Word Type (F
(2,89.99) = 3.92, p < .023). Planned comparisons assessing the se­
mantic ambiguity effect revealed significant differences between poly­
semes and unambiguous words (t (4690) = -2.29, p = 0.022; beta =

the root level, which continues to drive processing even at later stages.
In Arabic, the root morpheme, which is central to lexical access, carries
core semantic and structural information that appears to remain active
throughout the word-recognition process (Boudelaa & Marslen-Wilson,
2005; 2015; Prior & Markus, 2014). Unlike in languages where hom­
onymy introduces competition at the lexical–semantic level, the Arabic
root system seems to provide a stabilizing context that reduces compe­
tition among words. Thus, the absence of a homonym disadvantage may
reflect the unique role of morphological knowledge in prioritizing
structural coherence over purely semantic resolution.
Alternatively, the absence of a reliable disadvantage may stem from
the artificial nature of the pseudohomophones used in this experiment.
Our pseudohomophones were Standard Arabic words written with
Egyptian Arabic sounds (e.g., ‫ ﻣﻤﺴﻞ‬/mumassil/ for ‫ ﻣﻤﺜﻞ‬/mumaθil/ actor).
These stimuli may have engaged additional processes, such as height­
ened attention to orthographic verification or language control mecha­
nisms, which could have masked the expected effects of semantic
competition.3
To address this limitation and further investigate the role of the root
as a unit that mitigates lexical competition, Experiment 3 uses nonwords
formed by the illegal combination of existing roots (e.g., {ktm} meaning
hide) with existing word patterns (e.g., {CaCyC} singular masculine, noun
expressing intensity, permanence, or a descriptive attribute), producing
semantically interpretable nonwords such as katym, which can be un­
derstood as referring to someone or something that hides a lot. These
nonwords are expected to be particularly challenging to reject due to
their familiar roots and word patterns and their semantic plausibility.
Functionally analogous nonwords in English, such as “mirths”—created
by combining the existing stem “mirth” with the suffix ~ s—have been
shown to pose a great challenge, requiring more detailed analysis to
determine that the stem and suffix combination does not form a valid
word (Taft, 2004; see also Longtin & Meunier, 2005 for similar data in
French). In this study, these semantically plausible nonwords were ex­
pected to slow response latencies and increase error rates while mini­
mizing interference from language control mechanisms, thereby
allowing semantic competition to emerge.

0.04]) or from polysemes (z = 1.73, p = .082; beta = -0.47, 95 % CI
[-0.81, − 0.13]).
Discussion
Experiment 2 shows that the use of pseudohomophones slows reac­
tion times and increases error rates, confirming their role in introducing
competition between dialectal and MSA representations at a lexical
level. Participants must suppress the dialectal interpretation to reject
these items as MSA nonwords, akin to bilingual lexical decision tasks
where non-target language words slow responses due to cross-linguistic
competition (Dijkstra, Van Jaarsveld & Ten Brinke, 1998; Vanlangen­
donck et al., 2020). This decision-stage conflict prolongs response times,
increases error rates, and requires more extensive processing to resolve
the competition, thus providing an opportunity for semantic processes to
unfold following the recombination stage.
Polysemes were processed faster than homonyms and unambiguous
words, supporting the idea that the related senses of polysemes coop­
erate to facilitate quicker and more accurate semantic resolution (Rodd
et al., 2002; 2004; Armstrong & Plaut, 2016). In contrast, homonyms
showed no reliable disadvantage compared to unambiguous words,
challenging the idea that the unrelated meanings of homonyms create
competition that delays processing and increases errors. These findings
suggest that while polysemes enjoy a clear processing advantage, the
anticipated disadvantage for homonyms does not reliably emerge, even
under conditions designed to prolong processing time.
Although the error rate for unambiguous words reached 17.26 %,
this likely reflects a genuine processing difficulty, specifically
phonological-orthographic conflict, rather than data degradation.
Comparable error rates (>20 %) have been observed in German lexical
decision tasks with pseudo-derived words (e.g., Bölte et al., 2025),
where high error rates signify increased cognitive demand rather than
noise. Critically, in our study, the elevated error rates did not compro­
mise latency data, as sufficient observations remained for the RT ana­
lyses. The higher error rate for unambiguous words likely stems from
limited access to semantic or morphological cues that could otherwise
resolve decision conflicts.
The absence of a homonym disadvantage could have different cau­
ses. One possibility is the sustained influence of bottom-up activation at

Experiment 3: Lexical decision with semantically interpretable
nonwords
The aim of this experiment was to determine whether the use of
semantically interpretable nonwords can engage in deeper semantic
processing, such that bottom-up activation from the root level to the
word level is counteracted by competition within the word level (i.e.,
lateral inhibition). Specifically, this study investigates whether hom­
onymic meanings derived from the same root exhibit measurable
competition during recognition. The nonwords were created by illegally
pairing valid roots (e.g., {ktm}, hiding, {ktb} writing) with valid word
patterns (e.g., {CaCEyC}, {CaCwC}), producing semantically interpret­
able but invalid constructions such as “katym” and “katwb,” interpret­
able as secretive and prolific writer respectively. This approach parallels
the morphologically legal but lexically invalid combinations used in
Hebrew by Norman, Degani, and Peleg (2017). Such stimuli were ex­
pected to challenge participants due to their morphological and se­
mantic plausibility, making them difficult to reject and requiring
prolonged cognitive effort to disambiguate their lexical status. This
extended processing should allow competition among unrelated se­
mantic meanings to emerge while maintaining the obligatory decom­
position processes characteristic of Semitic languages.

Method

Latencies. A linear mixed-effects model predicting log-transformed re­
action times (logRT) from Word Type, with random intercepts for Target
and Subject, revealed the main effect of Word Type to be significant (F
(2,95.56) = 4.55, p < .013). Planned comparisons assessing ambiguity
effects yielded a reliable difference between polysemous and unambig­
uous words (t (3868) = -2.14, p < 0.032, beta = -0.04, 95 % CI [-0.09,
− 3.78e-03]), and homonym and unambiguous words (t (3868) = 2.56,
p < 0.010, beta = 0.05, 95 % CI [0.01, 0.09]. The effects of meaning
relatedness, as revealed by the contrast between polysemes and hom­
onyms, was statistically significant (t (3871) = 4.74, p < 0.000, beta =
-0.10, 95 % CI [-0.14, − 0.06]).

Participants
Forty-seven participants from the same population as in the previous
two experiments participated voluntarily or for course credit. All par­
ticipants were adults with normal (corrected-to-normal) vision and no
reading or learning disorders. All participants provided informed con­
sent before the experiment and agreed to participate freely.
Stimuli
The word stimuli comprised the same 102 items, with 34 polysemes,
34 homonyms, and 34 unambiguous words. Additionally, 102 ortho­
tactically and phonotactically legal nonwords (e.g., “munfakir,” “snyd”)
were created by illegally combining existing roots (e.g., {fkr} thinking,
{snd} supporting/relying on) with existing word patterns (e.g., {munCa­
CiC} = passive, reflexive, {CaCyC} = intensive). These nonwords are
semantically interpretable. For example, “munfakir” can mean “someone
who is deeply reflective, or engaged in serious thought” and “sanyd” can
mean “someone who provides support, help, or acts as a reliable companion.”
These were matched to the word stimuli on number of letters (Mean =
4.78, SD = 0.57), syllable count (Mean = 2.39, SD = 0.55), and ortho­
graphic neighborhood density (OLD20; Mean = 1.90, SD = 0.17),
ensuring comparability across the word-nonword types. These non­
words were expected to be difficult to reject, leading to slower response
latencies and higher error rates. More importantly, they were expected
to systematically engage the recombination stage to determine whether
a combined word is valid or meaningful. As a result, competition among
the multiple unrelated meanings of homonyms will have time to
develop, while cooperation among the related meanings of polysemes
will have time to peak or diminish.

Accuracies. A logistic mixed-effects model predicting Error as a function
of Word Type, with Target and Subject as random effects revealed the
effect of polysemous words to be significant compared to unambiguous
words (z = -3.33, p < .001; beta = -0.95, 95 % CI [-1.50, − 0.39]).
Surprisingly, homonymy showed a significant decrease in error rate
compared to the unambiguous words (z = -2.21, p < .027; beta = -0.62,
95 % CI [-1.17, − 0.07]). The difference between polysemes and hom­
onyms was not significant (z = 1.138, p = 0.255; beta = -0.33, 95 % CI
[-0.89, 0.24]).
Discussion
When participants had to recombine roots and word patterns to
determine the specific semantic interpretation of lexical forms, the dy­
namics of semantic cooperation among related meanings and competi­
tion among unrelated meanings emerged in full swing. Specifically, the
results reveal a clear semantic advantage for polysemes, with related
meanings recognized faster and more accurately. This suggests that
facilitation from a common root morpheme persists into later processing
stages of polysemes. In contrast, the unrelated meanings of homonyms
show a processing disadvantage compared to polysemes and unambig­
uous words.
Semantically interpretable nonwords highlight the impact of se­
mantic plausibility on decision-making. Participants found these stimuli
particularly challenging to reject because their morphological and se­
mantic structures mimicked real words. This plausibility forced deeper
semantic processing as participants analyzed the validity of each
recombined root and word pattern. The extended processing time
allowed competitive dynamics among unrelated meanings and cooper­
ative effects among related meanings to emerge. In Experiment 4, we
seek converging evidence for the cooperation and competition processes
in polysemes and homonyms using a semantic categorization task with a
narrow and well-defined category, namely the “Food category.”.

Procedure
The procedure was identical to Experiments 1 and 2, except partic­
ipants were explicitly informed that the experiment contained items that
appeared very word-like because they involved existing roots and word
patterns (e.g., “glyb,” consisting of the root {glb} and the word pattern
{CaCyC}). Participants were instructed that while such items might
seem interpretable, they were not actual words and should therefore be
rejected as nonwords.
Results
A total of 19.19 % of the data were excluded from the analysis (19.17
% errors and 0.062 % outliers), leaving 3874 valid data points. The
average response time in this experiment (Mean = 687.67 ms, SD = 6.96
ms) was considerably higher than that in Experiment 1 (Mean = 575.33
ms, SD = 4.66 ms). Similarly, the overall error rate in this experiment
(Mean = 19.19 %, SD = 0.39 %) was significantly higher than that in
Experiment 1 (mean = 4.94 %, SD = 0.21 %). These findings indicate
that the nonwords used in this experiment behaved as expected effec­
tively slowing down response times and eliciting higher error rates.
Average RT’s, accuracy rates, ambiguity and relatedness effects are
summarized in Table 5a.

Experiment 4: Semantic categorization with food terms
In the previous three experiments, we used a lexical decision task and
progressively increased nonword difficulty, causing participants to shift
from relying on orthographic familiarity to deeper semantic processing.
This shift revealed full semantic processing dynamics at play in Arabic,
ranging from cooperation among the related senses of polysemes to

competition among the multiple unrelated meanings of homonyms.
Experiments 4 and 5 extend Experiments 1–3 by using a semantic
categorization paradigm. This tested whether the previously observed
effects of homonymy and polysemy persisted at deeper levels of se­
mantic integration. As Arabic requires obligatory morphological
decomposition, particularly of root morphemes, these experiments offer
a unique opportunity to observe how morphological activation con­
tinues to influence meaning resolution when lexical access is followed
by semantic categorization. Beginning with Experiment 4, we used a
semantic categorization task that involved deciding whether a word fits
within a narrow semantic category (e.g., Living Things, “Vegetables,”
and so on). Specifically, we use a well-defined small category, a “Food
category,” to establish whether cooperative and competitive processes
can be observed in Arabic in a task that directly engages semantic pro­
cessing. Two outcomes are anticipated here. First, it is conceivable that
we replicate the results of Experiment 3 with a semantic advantage for
polysemes and a semantic disadvantage for homonyms. This is because
semantic categorization cannot be based on the orthographic familiarity
of letter strings or the root as an orthographic/phonological unit.
Instead, deep semantic processing based on the recombined words is
required to determine whether a given target belongs to a given cate­
gory. Alternatively, however, and as suggested by Forster (2004) and
Hino et al., (2006), participants may resort to a “candidate search
strategy” whereby they generate potential exemplars from the small
“Food category” and compare these directly to the target. This strategy
should reduce the reliance on full lexical/semantic processing and limit
the scope for the emergence of full semantic processing dynamics.

“No” key. The “Yes” response was made using the participant’s domi­
nant hand. The response accuracy and response latency from the onset of
the stimulus to the participant’s key-press were automatically recorded
in each trial. Twenty practice trials were conducted prior to the exper­
imental trials. The practice trials mimicked the experimental trials,
consisting of 10 food-word and 10 nonfood-word trials. In all other re­
spects, the procedure was identical to that used in the previous
experiments.
Results
Performance was highly accurate, with only 1.06 % of the data
excluded from the analysis (0.92 % errors and 0.12 % outliers), leaving
4848 valid data points. The average overall response latencies in this
experiment (Mean = 761 ms, SE = 6.02) are much higher than even the
latencies of Experiment 3 (Mean = 687.67 ms, SE = 6.96), because the
responses of interest here are the “NO” responses. However, the overall
error rate in this experiment (Mean = 1.06 %, SD = 0.09) was signifi­
cantly lower than that observed in previous experiments. Mean RTs,
accuracy rates, ambiguity and relatedness effects for this experiment are
summarized in Table 6a.
Latencies. A similar linear mixed-effects model predicting logtransformed reaction times (logRT) based on Word Type, with random
intercepts for Target and Subject as in the previous experiments,
revealed the main effect of Word Type to be unreliable (F(2,93.18) =
2.26, p = .10). Planned comparisons showed that the contrast between
Polysemes and Unambiguous words was reliable (t (4842) = -2.13, p =
0.033, beta = -0.05, 95 % CI [-0.09, − 3.83e-03]). However, neither the
Homonyms vs. Unambiguous contrast (t (4842) = -1.04, p = 0.300, beta
= -0.02, 95 % CI [-0.07, 0.02]) nor the Polysemes vs. Homonyms
contrast (t (4842) = 1.08, p = .285, beta = -0.02, 95 % CI [-0.07, 0.02])
reached significance.

Method
Participants
Fifty participants from the same population voluntarily participated
in the study or received course credit. All the participants were adults
with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and reported no reading or
learning disorders. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Accuracies. A logistic mixed-effects model as in prior experiments
revealed no significant differences either between Polysemes and Un­
ambiguous (z = − 0.290, p = .772; beta = − 0.12, 95 % CI [− 0.93, 0.69]),
Homonyms and Unambiguous (z = − 1.915, p = .0555; beta = − 0.95, 95
% CI [− 1.92, 0.02]), or Polysemes and Homonyms (z = 1.66, p = .096;
beta = 1.62, 95 % CI [− 0.29, 3.54]).

Stimuli
Of the 102 stimulus items used in the previous experiments, we
discarded two homonymic and two unambiguous words because of their
close association with the Food Category. Accordingly, the stimuli
consisted of 98 items, with 34 polysemes, 32 homonyms, and 32 un­
ambiguous words. Additionally, 98 items falling within the category of
food were selected including names of fruits (e.g., ‫ ﻋﻨﺐ‬grapes, ‫ﺭّﻣﺎﻥ‬
pomegranate), vegetable (e.g., ‫ ﺑﺼﻞ‬onion, ‫ ﺳﺒﺎﻧﺦ‬spinach), grains and staples
(e.g., ‫ ﺭﻏﻴﻒ‬loaf of bread, ‫ ﺃﺭﺯ‬rice). To establish how typical the different
examples were in the category, we administered a subjective judgment
pretest to 30 new participants who were asked to rate the typicality of
294 items, including 98 food words, 98 experimental items (polysemes,
homonyms, and unambiguous), and 98 foils. These items were inter­
mixed and presented in a randomized order to minimize potential order
effects. Participants rated each item on a 1–7 scale, with 1 indicating not
typical of food at all and 7 indicating very typical of food and were
instructed to base their judgments on their intuitive sense of how
representative the item was of the Food category. The results of this
pretest indicated that the “food” words were all highly typical members
of the category (Mean = 6.60, SD = 0.40), while polysemes, homonyms
and unambiguous words received much lower typicality ratings (Mean
= 1.92, SD = 0.45; Mean = 1.88, SD = 0.48; Mean = 1.89, SD = 0.53
respectively). Besides, the food words closely matched the experimental
items overall in terms of the number of letters (Mean = 4.11, SD = 1.00),
number of syllables (Mean = 2.09, SD = 0.70), and OLD20 (Mean =
1.79, SD = 0.33).

Discussion
The results of Experiment 4 contribute to our understanding of se­
mantic categorization processes in Arabic. The high accuracy rates and
relatively slower response latencies compared to the lexical decision
tasks in the previous three experiments suggest that participants
engaged in deeper semantic processing when determining whether a
word fits within the Food category. The use of a small, well-defined
semantic category likely required a recombination semantic process­
ing stage, as participants assessed the meaning of the target word to
establish category membership.

A key finding here is the semantic ambiguity advantage observed for
polysemous words, which elicit significantly faster reaction times than
both homonyms and unambiguous words, highlighting the cooperative
dynamics among related meanings. However, we did not observe any
evidence of a processing disadvantage for homonyms in this experiment.
As Forster (2004) and Hino et al., (2006) suggested, this may reflect the
adoption of a “candidate search strategy,” whereby participants
generate exemplars from a small category, compare them directly to the
target, and output their responses. This strategy likely reduces reliance
on full-lexical or semantic processing, thereby diminishing competitive
effects among unrelated meanings. Consequently, the ambiguity disad­
vantage, which is typically associated with homonyms in tasks requiring
comprehensive semantic processing, may not be observed in this
context. In the final experiment, we use a semantic categorization task
with a broad category that should preempt the use of a “candidate search
strategy” and should in principle allow us to observe a semantic ambi­
guity advantage for polysemes and a disadvantage for homonyms in
Arabic.

Procedure
This was the same as Experiment 4, except that the “Yes” response
corresponded to the Living Thing item.
Results
Of the total 9,498 data points, 7.39 % were errors and 0.06 % were
outliers, both excluded from the analysis. The average response latency
(Mean = 823.75 ms, SE = 6.38) were significantly higher than in
Experiment 4, as was the average error rate (Mean = 7.10 %, SE =
0.005). Mean RTs, accuracy rates, ambiguity and relatedness effects are
summarized in Table 7a.
Latencies
A similar linear mixed-effects model predicting log-transformed re­
action times (logRT) based on Word Type, with random intercepts for
Target and Subject, as in the previous experiments, revealed a reliable
main effect of Word Type (F(2, 98.756) = 6.588, p < .002). Planned
comparison revealed the Polysemes to be indistinguishable from the
Unambiguous words (t (4716) = -0.69, p < 0.493, beta = -0.01, 95 % CI
[-0.06, 0.03]). Conversely, the Homonyms were statistically different
from both the Unambiguous (t (4716) = 2.74, p = .006, beta = 0.06, 95
% CI [0.02, 0.10]) and the Polysemes (t (4719) = 3.43, p = .00088, beta
= -0.07, 95 % CI [-0.11, − 0.03]), thus revealing a semantic ambiguity
disadvantage for Homonyms but no processing advantage for
Polysemes.

Experiment 5: Semantic categorization with living thing words
In Experiment 4, we used a well-defined, small semantic category
(food) which minimized the processing disadvantage for homonyms,
suggesting that participants likely generated potential exemplars from
the Food category and directly compared them to the target, thereby
reducing reliance on full lexical/semantic processing (Forster, 2004;
Hino et al., 2006). In Experiment 5, we used a large and semantically
diverse category, the Living Thing. Unlike smaller categories, larger
categories demand extensive re-combinatory processes, that is, recom­
bining the root and word pattern to evaluate the fit of a target word
within a large category. This shift in processing is expected to reveal the
full extent of ambiguity effects, including advantages for polysemes and
disadvantages for homonyms, thereby offering a more comprehensive
understanding of semantic ambiguity in a Semitic context.

Accuracies
A logistic mixed-effects model like the ones fitted for the previous
experiments revealed no significant difference either between Polyse­
mous and Unambiguous words (z = -1.375, p = .169; beta = -0.40, 95 %
CI [-0.98, 0.17]), or between Polysemous and Homonymous words (z =
0.877, p = .380; beta = 0.27, 95 % CI [-0.33, 0.86]). The only contrast
that reached significance was between the Homonymous and Unam­
biguous words (z = -2.241, p < .025, (beta = -0.67, 95 % CI [-1.26,
− 0.08]).

Method
Participants
Another 50 participants from the same population voluntarily
participated in the experiment. All participants were adults with normal
or corrected-to-normal vision and reported no reading or learning dis­
orders. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Discussion
Experiment 5 investigated the cognitive processing demands of se­
mantic categorization using a large, diverse Living Things category,
compared to the smaller, well-defined category used in Experiment 4.
This diverse category necessitated more elaborate semantic processing
to determine category membership.
The results shed light on the processing dynamics of semantic am­
biguity. RTs were significantly slower than in the previous four experi­
ments, and error rates were higher than those in Experiments 1 and 4,
suggesting increased cognitive effort in processing the semantically
diverse Living Things category. Specifically, while homonyms exhibited
a clear disadvantage in response latencies relative to both unambiguous
and polysemous words, they also yielded significantly lower error rates

Stimuli
The same set of stimuli were used as in Experiments 1–3. These
consisted of 34 polysemes, 34 homonyms, and 34 unambiguous words.
Additionally, 102 Living Thing items were selected including names of
animals (e.g., ‫ ﺳﻤﻜﺔ‬fish, ‫ ﺣﻤﺎﻣﺔ‬pigeon), plants (e.g., ‫ ﺯﻫﺮﺓ‬flower, ‫ ﻧﺨﻠﺔ‬palm tree),
insects and small creatures (e.g., ‫ ﺑﺮﻏﻮﺙ‬flea, ‫ ﺣﺸﺮﺓ‬insect). To determine
how typical the Living Thing category was, we administered a subjective
judgment pretest to 30 new participants who were asked to rate the
typicality of 306 items, including 102 Living Thing words, 102 experi­
mental items (polysemes, homonyms, and unambiguous), and 102 foils.
All items were intermixed and presented in a randomized order. Par­
ticipants rated each item on a 1–7 scale, where 1 indicated not typical of
Living Things at all and 7 indicated very typical of Living Thing. The par­
ticipants were instructed to base their judgments on their intuitive sense
of how typical the item was of the Living-Thing category. The results of
this pre-test indicated that Living Thing words were all highly typical
members of the category (Mean = 6.79, SD = 0.46), while polysemes,
homonyms, and unambiguous words received much lower typicality
ratings (Mean = 1.90, SD = 0.40; Mean = 1.91, SD = 0.42; Mean = 1.88,
SD = 0.45, respectively). Living Thing words were also closely matched
to the experimental items in number of letters (Mean = 4.31, SD = 1.02),
number of syllables (Mean = 2.17, SD = 0.66), and OLD20 (Mean =
1.85, SD = 0.38).

than unambiguous words, a facilitation in accuracy that was statistically
reliable (see Table 7a). This dual pattern—slower but more accurate
responses for homonyms, and faster but more error-prone responses for
unambiguous words—resembles a speed-accuracy tradeoff. However,
this does not undermine the interpretation of a processing cost for
homonyms. Rather than a simple strategic shift, the increased RTs for
homonyms likely reflect greater semantic competition, not just a general
caution or slowed response tendency. Conversely, the faster but less
accurate performance on unambiguous items could reflect shallower
processing under increased task demands. Thus, both measur­
es—latency and accuracy—point to distinct cognitive dynamics associ­
ated with semantic ambiguity, and we interpret their divergence as
complementary, not contradictory.
These finding underscore the cognitive cost of the semantic compe­
tition inherent in homonyms, where multiple meanings compete for
recognition. Polysemes on the other hand showed no processing
advantage over unambiguous words, suggesting that the ambiguity
advantage diminishes over time as deeper lexical processing occurs
(Armstrong & Plaut, 2016). Overall, these findings highlight the role of
category scope in modulating semantic ambiguity effects. While small,
well-defined categories may obscure such effects, broader, diverse cat­
egories, such as the Living Thing category, reveal the full cognitive cost
of homonym processing. In addition, the absence of polyseme advantage
suggests that the coactivation of related senses occurs in early
processing.

root morphemes, continued to shape performance, even during later
semantic decision stages. This highlights the uniquely persistent role of
morphology in Arabic and supports the idea that ambiguity resolution is
not only semantic but also morphologically constrained in Semitic lan­
guages. Taken together, these findings highlight the interplay among
task demands, morphological decomposition, and recombination. The
lexical decision task as used here taps onto the early operations of the
morphological disassembly of Arabic words into roots and word pat­
terns. Once the root is parsed, it is used to access the lexicon; since
polysemes and homonyms have one root associated with multiple
related senses in one case and multiple unrelated meanings in another, it
provides a basis for a semantic ambiguity advantage in both cases. Tasks
that require deeper semantic processing (e.g., Experiment 5) or more
stringent verification of the nonwords (e.g., Experiment 3) tap, not onto
the initial decomposition process, but onto the recombination stage,
where the root and the word pattern are reassembled to form a coherent
interpretation of the word (Boudelaa, 2014, Boudelaa & MarslenWilson, 2015; cf., Taft, 2004). In the case of non-transparent words,
where meaning is not combinatorial, as in the case of polysemes and
homonyms, this stage is particularly crucial for establishing a finegrained interpretation of the word. At this stage, the related senses of
the polysemes are not sufficiently related to cooperate, while the unre­
lated meanings of the homonyms are divergent enough to compete;
hence, the homonym disadvantage and the polyseme lack of advantage.
We have yet to discuss the behavior of unambiguous words, which,
with the exception of Experiment 1, consistently occupied an interme­
diate position in reaction times across the experiments. Indeed, these
words were systematically slower than polysemes but faster than hom­
onyms in the more demanding tasks (Experiments 3 and 5). To account
for this, a feedback mechanism involving the interactions between se­
mantic and lexical representations may be helpful (Kawamoto, 1993;
Kawamoto, Farrar & Kello, 1994; Pexman & Lupker, 1999; Pexman,
Lupker & Hino, 2002). Under this scenario, unambiguous words may
initially receive less recurrent feedback because of their unitary mean­
ings, which limits the reinforcement of activation pathways and leads to
slower recognition compared to polysemes in early processing stages
(Experiment 1). In contrast, polysemous and homonymous words acti­
vate broader, more interactive networks. As task difficulty increases and
recombination processes become necessary (Experiments 3 and 5), the
lack of overlapping or competing representations for unambiguous
words may hinder their adaptability, preventing them from benefiting
from the cooperative dynamics that aid polysemes, yet allowing them to
avoid the full competitive cost that hinders homonyms. This results in
their stable, intermediate level of processing.

General discussion
Across five experiments, this study examined how the unique
morphological structure of Arabic shapes semantic ambiguity. Experi­
ment 1 used a lexical decision task with nonwords based on non-existent
roots to demonstrate a processing advantage for both polysemes and
homonyms compared to unambiguous words, with polysemes showing a
larger advantage. These results highlight the early stage of Arabic word
recognition—morphological decomposition—where roots and word
patterns are extracted, and the root serves as a primary access unit to the
lexicon. This mechanism facilitates efficient lexical access for both
polysemes and homonyms because the shared morphological unit sup­
ports activation regardless of semantic relatedness (Boudelaa, 2014;
Boudelaa & Marslen-Wilson, 2015; Boudelaa et al., 2023, 2024; see also
Frost et al., 1997).
Experiment 2 introduced pseudohomophones, increasing task
complexity, and slowing down RTs. Here polysemes retained their
advantage, but homonyms showed no disadvantage, suggesting that
root-based decomposition continued to stabilize their processing.
Experiment 3, used semantically interpretable nonwords that required
recombination to verify lexical and semantic validity. Under such con­
ditions, polysemes displayed a robust advantage due to cooperative
dynamics among related meanings, whereas homonyms exhibited a
marked disadvantage, as competition among unrelated meanings had
sufficient time to build and emerge following recombination (Boudelaa,
2015; Hino et al., 2002; Rodd et al., 2004; Taft, 2004).
Experiment 4, using a small, well-defined Food category minimized
homonym competition by enabling exemplar matching. This reduced
reliance on morphological recombination processes, and allowed poly­
semes to retain their advantage. Conversely, Experiment 5, with its
broad Living Things category, required full recombination, revealing a
homonym disadvantage owing to semantic competition. The polyseme
advantage diminished in the context of the broad semantic category,
suggesting their cooperative dynamics lost momentum over time
(Forster, 2004; Hino et al., 2002, 2006).
The use of both lexical decision and semantic categorization tasks
enabled us to examine the extent to which the morphological structure
of Arabic influences different levels of processing. While Experiments
1–3 demonstrated effects during lexical access, Experiments 4 and 5
revealed that morphological activation, specifically the activation of

Theoretical implications
In this section, we consider the implications of our findings for the
three models we mentioned in the introduction, namely the Attractor
Network Model (Rodd et al., 2004), the Semantic Settling Dynamics
(SSD) model (Armstrong & Plaut, 2008, 2016), and the Response
Configuration Model (Hino et al., 2006).
The Attractor Network Model (Rodd et al., 2004) conceptualizes
meanings as stable states (attractors) within a high-dimensional se­
mantic space. Specifically, polysemes (e.g., twist) share a single, broad,
and shallow attractor basin, enabling faster recognition, as the network
can more easily settle into these overlapping representations, whereas
homonyms (e.g., bark) form distinct, shallow attractor basins, causing
interference and slower recognition owing to competition between
meanings. Our findings are consistent with this model. The polyseme
advantage in the early processing stages is predicted by this account. In
contrast, the behavior of homonyms that showed an advantage over
unambiguous words in Experiment 1 is clearly at variance with this
model, which does not leave any room for co-activation among the
multiple unrelated meanings of a homonym. Incorporating a morpho­
logical pre-processing layer to capture root activation may address this

shortcoming by directly acknowledging root-based decomposition,
particularly in the early processing stages of Arabic.
The second model, the Semantic Settling Dynamics, or (SSD)
(Armstrong & Plaut, 2008, 2016), explains the effects of semantic am­
biguity as arising from the temporal dynamics of semantic processing.
Here, polysemous words with overlapping semantic features benefit
from cooperative dynamics early, leading to processing advantages. In
contrast, homonymous words with distinct and competing meanings
experience growing interference over time, resulting in processing dis­
advantages. This model accounts for the emergence of a homonym
disadvantage as the task becomes more difficult (e.g., Experiments 3 and
5). However, it fails to capture the task-dependent effects evident in
homonym stability (Experiment 2) or the diminished polyseme advan­
tage in broad semantic categorization tasks (Experiment 5). The most
challenging result for this model though is the processing advantage for
Homonyms in Experiment 1. Like the Attractor Network model, how­
ever, the SSD could, in principle, be extended to incorporate a
morphological layer where Arabic words are disassembled into roots
and word patterns to capture the root-based homonym advantage.
The final model, the Response Configuration Model (Hino et al.,
2006), proposes that semantic ambiguity effects stem not from differ­
ences in the semantic representations themselves, but from how these
representations are mapped onto the response system across tasks. Hino
et al., (2006) argued that the relatedness of meanings or senses in­
fluences task-specific configurations: homonyms with distinct meanings
may introduce competition, whereas polysemes with related senses can
simplify response decisions. The configuration of the response system,
modulated by task demands, determines whether ambiguity yields
processing advantages or disadvantages. Our results align with this
perspective, particularly when explaining the disadvantages of hom­
onyms in larger semantic categories (Experiment 5). However, the
consistent polyseme advantage across tasks suggests that morphological
factors contribute substantially beyond response strategies. As this
model focuses on response configuration, it is difficult to incorporate a
pre-semantic morphological stage into the framework to accommodate
the full scope of the current findings.
In summary, our findings illuminate the limitations and strengths of
existing models in explaining semantic ambiguity effects in Arabic, a
language with a rich morphological structure. The Attractor Network
and SSD models capture the interplay of competition and cooperation
but lack the necessary morphological component to explain early-stage
morphology-driven effects. Conversely, the Response Configuration
Model provides valuable insights into task-dependent variability but
lacks information about linguistic structure needed to address cross-task
consistency. Collectively, our findings underscore the need to adapt
cognitive models to the linguistic typology of diverse languages,
ensuring that they are sufficiently general to account for the universal
aspects of semantic processing while remaining specific enough to
capture the idiosyncratic properties of different languages. Finally, we
note that the tasks in this study were temporally coarse, providing a
single data point per word per participant. Future research should use
more fine-grained experimental techniques, such as EEG or MEG, to
capture the dynamic neural processes involved in semantic ambiguity
resolution in Arabic, enabling a more precise understanding of its tem­
poral progression and spatial localization.
