Introduction
Words that have been read aloud are remembered better than words
that have been read silently (MacLeod et al., 2010). This robust phenomenon—the production effect—also extends beyond speaking to production via writing, mouthing, whispering, and even singing (e.g.,
Forrin et al., 2012; Quinlan & Taylor, 2013, 2019), and beyond individual words to longer texts (Ozubko et al., 2012b; Roberts et al., 2024).
MacLeod and Bodner (2017) provide a brief review of this burgeoning
literature.
The production effect has primarily been explained as due to the
distinctive processing applied to the produced items (Conway & Gathercole, 1987; Forrin et al., 2012; MacLeod et al., 2010; MacLeod &
Bodner, 2017). According to the relative distinctiveness account, the act of
producing an item during encoding results in the formation of an itemspecific, distinctive record that is then useful during retrieval. Produced
items are distinctive in the sense that they have additional, item-specific,
production-associated features encoded in memory—including auditory

and articulatory features (Forrin & MacLeod, 2018)—thereby differentiating them from items studied silently. Computational modeling of the
production effect has captured this by storing in memory additional
features for the produced items (Cyr et al., 2022; Jamieson et al., 2016;
Kelly et al., 2022). Participants may also benefit from this distinctive
record through use of a distinctiveness heuristic at test (Dodson &
Schacter, 2001), a strategy that involves trying to retrieve whether a
word on the test was produced at study. Remembering having spoken a
word during the study phase is an additional way to verify that it was
indeed studied.
An alternative explanation of the production effect posits that the
produced items are more strongly encoded than the silent items (Bodner
& Taikh, 2012; Fawcett, 2013; Fawcett & Ozubko, 2016). Under this
strength account, the act of producing an item simply results in a stronger
memory representation being formed during encoding. Fawcett and
Ozubko (2016) provided evidence for influences of both distinctiveness
and strength (see also Ozubko et al., 2012a). They used two approaches—Remember/Know judgments (see Gardiner, 1988) and receiver

rejected as ‘new’ on the basis of lacking verbatim detail associated with
retrieval of the true ‘old’ items.
In activation monitoring theory, false recognition is assumed to arise
from strong semantic activation in conjunction with failures of source
monitoring. In fuzzy-trace theory, false recognition is assumed to arise
from strong gist traces in the absence of verbatim recall. Consequently,
both of these frameworks assume that false recognition is primarily a
result of the retrieval of semantic information shared by the critical lure
and the presented items (i.e., the common activation in a semantic
network, or the gist trace).
There is also a third kind of theoretical framework: global-matching
models (Arndt, 2010; Hintzman, 1988; Shiffrin & Steyvers, 1997). These
accounts propose that false recognition arises because critical lures are
highly similar to the memory representations of the presented items.
This similarity can be due to shared semantics but it can also be due to
shared context. This account can explain why, when responding to the
critical lure, participants often retrieve specific visual, auditory, and
contextual details shared with actually studied items (Lampinen et al.,
2005; Payne et al., 1996).

operating characteristic (ROC) confidence ratings (Yonelinas, 1994,
1997)—to dissociate the effect of production on recollection versus familiarity. Computational modeling of the production effect has usually
modeled strength by increasing the likelihood that a feature is accurately copied into memory for the produced items (Jamieson et al.,
2016; Kelly et al., 2022).
In the production effect, distinctiveness is viewed as operating primarily via recollective processes because the produced features provide
a basis for a recollection boost during retrieval. In contrast, memory
strength could reflect familiarity as well as recollection. Fawcett and
Ozubko (2016; see also MacLeod & Bodner, 2017) have argued that
familiarity alone underlies the small advantage for production seen in
between-subjects, pure-list manipulations—a strength effect. In
contrast, both familiarity and recollection underlie the considerably
larger effect seen in within-subject, mixed-list manipulations—a
strength effect plus a larger distinctiveness effect.
The phenomenon of false memory
In the present investigation, we set out to explore the influence of
production in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm (Deese,
1959; Roediger & McDermott, 1995), the widely used procedure for
inducing false memories for words. In this paradigm, participants study
a list of words (e.g., bed, rest, awake…), all of which are semantically
related to a non-presented word (e.g., sleep), known as the critical lure.
Although it is never presented during study, participants nonetheless
show substantial false recognition of the critical lure; indeed, this is even
seen when attention to the studied words is very limited (Dodd &
MacLeod, 2004). Moreover, false memories experienced in the DRM
paradigm are often subjectively compelling. For instance, when participants are asked to distinguish whether they Remember or Know that a
word was studied (Tulving, 1985; Gardiner, 1988), false recognition of
the critical lure is often experienced in the “Remember” sense (e.g.,
Payne et al., 1996; Roediger & McDermott, 1995): The critical lure is not
just familiar but actually seems to be recollected as having been studied.
One of the major theoretical accounts of false memory, activation
monitoring theory (Roediger et al., 2001), posits that false recognition is
a result of the interplay of automatic spreading activation and a more
controlled source-monitoring process. As each word is presented, activation spreads to associated words that are connected in a semantic
network (Anderson, 1983; Collins & Loftus, 1975). Because the critical
lure in the DRM paradigm is, by design, strongly associated with all of
the presented words, it is repeatedly activated during encoding of them.
Source monitoring involves participants making attributions about the
source of the aforementioned activation (i.e., distinguishing between
words that were actually presented versus those that were merely activated but not presented). Thus, false recognition of the critical lure occurs when that word is activated and the participant mistakenly
attributes the source of this activation to that word having been presented during study.
A second major theoretical account, fuzzy-trace theory (Reyna &
Brainerd, 1995), proposes that false recognition is a result of two types
of memory traces that are created in parallel during encoding: gist traces
and verbatim traces. Gist traces contain the general meaning or theme of
the information whereas verbatim traces contain item-specific, surface
information (Brainerd et al., 2001). In the DRM paradigm, despite never
having been presented during study, the critical lure is nonetheless
repeatedly semantically cued by the presented words, each of which was
selected for its association with the critical lure. Of course, the critical
lure also is highly consistent with the general theme of the list. Thus,
fuzzy-trace theory considers false recognition in the DRM paradigm to
be based predominantly on gist traces, with true recognition based on
both gist and verbatim traces. Under some circumstances, it is also
possible for verbatim traces to suppress false recognition in a process
known as recollection rejection (Brainerd et al., 2003): New yet gistconsistent items presented at test, notably the critical lure, can be

Production and false memory
In the series of experiments reported here, our aim was to determine
how production would influence false recognition in the DRM paradigm.
As has been repeatedly shown (see MacLeod & Bodner, 2017), production should benefit memory for the actually studied words, but how
would it affect the likelihood of falsely recognizing the critical (unstudied) lures?
Within a relative distinctiveness account, items read aloud are
rendered more distinctive compared to items read silently. This suggests
that it should be easier to reject the associated critical lures of words
studied aloud via recollection rejection, given that they would lack these
distinctive produced features in memory. Thus, this account would
predict a primarily recollection-based increase in true recognition for
words spoken aloud, but a decrease in false recognition, relative to
words read silently.
A strength account would appear to make a different prediction. If
strength primarily reflects familiarity (as argued by Fawcett & Ozubko,
2016), then for true recognition the words spoken aloud should be better
recognized than the words read silently. But now, reading words aloud
should also lead to greater false recognition than reading words silently.
That is, a strength-based account of production would predict primarily
familiarity-based increases in both true and false recognition.
Only two prior studies have investigated the influence of reading
aloud on DRM false recognition rates. Dodson and Schacter (2001,
Experiment 2) presented all lists visually and had participants read half
of the lists aloud and hear a recorded voice speak the other half of the
lists. They reported no difference in recognition of critical lures as a
function of whether words had been read aloud or read silently plus
heard. Culbreth and Putnam (2019) obtained the same result—no difference in false alarm rate to critical lures—when they used the more
usual production procedure of comparing reading words aloud to
reading them silently. Dodson and Schacter (2001, p. 158) compared the
null result of reading aloud on false recognition in their within-subject
experiment to their earlier finding of a lower false alarm rate for
aloud vs. heard words when using a between-subjects manipulation
(Dodson & Schacter, 2001, Experiment 1). They argued that in a
between-subjects design, participants successfully used a distinctiveness
heuristic (I remember saying it aloud, so it must be old), but in a withinsubject design “there is no longer a particular kind of information that
is solely diagnostic of a test item’s oldness or newness” (p. 158).
Other studies also have examined encoding manipulations in the
DRM procedure. Particularly relevant, Huff and Bodner (2013) showed
less false recognition after item-specific encoding than after relational
encoding. Huff et al. (2015) reviewed the influence of distinctive
encoding on correct and false recognition, in particular summarizing

per studied list, drawn from positions 1, 6, and 10), 10 critical lure
words (one per studied list), and 40 words that had not been presented.
Of the 40 non-presented words, 30 were taken from ten unstudied DRM
lists (again, three words for each given list were drawn from positions 1,
6, and 10), and the remaining 10 words were the critical lures for the ten
unstudied lists. This ensured that the distractors were comparable to the
targets. As in the study phase, on the recognition test each word was
presented in lowercase 30-pt Arial font against a white background,
except that now all test words were presented in black. The order of test
words was randomized for each participant. The Appendix contains all
of the stimuli.
Procedure. Participants sat in front of computer monitors and followed on-screen and/or oral instructions for the duration of the experiment. At the beginning of the experiment, all participants were given
the following instructions:

studies that showed less false recognition after generation of the list
items than after reading the items, a finding confirmed by Huff et al.
(2021). In these cases, it appears that emphasizing encoding of individual items in a DRM list resulted in less false recognition of critical
lures than did emphasizing connections among items in the list. This
different influence of encoding on false recognition than that observed
by Dodson and Schacter (2001) and by Culbreth and Putnam (2019) was
one of the motivations for us undertaking the present investigation.
Overview of the current investigation
In the experiments reported here, we manipulated production within
subject because that is where the larger effect of production is seen.
Thus, a random half of the DRM lists were read aloud during study, with
the other half read silently. We report a series of pre-registered experiments (Experiment 1a: https://osf.io/j3a6g; Experiment 1b: https://osf.
io/whbax; Experiment 2: https://osf.io/swkaj; Experiment 3a:
https://osf.io/xnzcv; Experiment 3b: https://osf.io/eg84a) that examined the effect of reading aloud versus silently on true and false memory.
All experiments were approved by the University of Waterloo Research
Ethics Board (protocol #41398).
In each experiment, participants were presented with ten 12-word
DRM lists. In Experiments 1a and 1b, participants were to read all of
the words in five of these DRM lists aloud and all of the words in the
other five lists silently. In Experiment 2, participants were to read all of
the words in five of the lists aloud and all of the words in the other five
lists silently while listening to those words spoken by another voice. In
these first three experiments, participants performed a recognition test
incorporating a tripartite decision: Remember vs. Know vs. New (see
Gardiner, 1988). Under this procedure, Remember judgments are taken
to index recollection whereas Know judgments are taken to index familiarity (see Yonelinas, 2002, for a review). Experiments 3a and 3b
were similar to Experiments 1a and 1b except that the recognition test
involved a binary response (Old vs. New), collapsing Remember/Know
into Old. We did this in part because it is how the Dodson and Schacter
(2001) and the Culbreth and Putnam (2019) studies were conducted and
in part to increase the generalizability of our study.

“You will be seeing a series of common words presented one at a time
at the center of the screen. If the word is blue [red], please read the
word out loud in a normal speaking voice. If the word is red [blue],
please read the word silently in your mind, without moving your
lips.”
Once they indicated that they understood the instructions, participants proceeded to the practice study task, where they read (aloud/
silently) five blue words and five red words to become familiar with the
procedure. They then proceeded to the study task proper, consisting of
the ten DRM lists of 12 words each. Each DRM list was presented in its
entirety before the next list began, and the order of the 10 lists was
randomized for each participant. All 120 words were presented
consecutively as a continuous stream; there were no breaks between the
DRM lists. Words were presented one at a time for 2000 ms each, with a
500-ms blank between successive words. Within each DRM list, words
were presented in a single consistent color and in a fixed order
(decreasing backward associative strength), as is typical of DRM studies
(e.g., Lu et al., 2020; Roediger & McDermott, 1995; Schacter et al.,
2001). Upon completion of the study phase, participants played onscreen Tetris (Experiment 1a, for five minutes; Experiment 1b, for two
minutes) before proceeding to the test phase.
Prior to the test phase, participants were given the following
instructions:

Experiments 1a and 1b

“In the next task, words will again be shown on the screen one at a
time. Some of these words were presented in the previous phase and
some were not. Your task is to decide whether each word is ‘Old’ (i.
e., it was presented in the previous phase) or ‘New’ (i.e., it was not
presented before). If you think the word was not presented before,
click the ‘New’ button. If you think the word was presented before,
there are two possible ‘Old’ responses that you can make. When you
clearly remember that the word was presented (i.e., you can recall
specific information about it, like that it was early in the list), click
the ‘Old: Remember’ button. When you feel that the item was presented before but you cannot recall specific details, click the ‘Old:
Know’ button.”

Method
Experiment 1a was conducted in person in the laboratory; Experiment 1b was conducted online and was remotely supervised by an
experimenter to ensure that participants followed the reading instructions. The general procedure for the two experiments was intentionally very similar so they are described together.
Participants. 80 students from the University of Waterloo participated for course credit in each experiment. This pre-registered sample
size was determined via a power analysis (Faul et al., 2007) using an
effect size of d = 0.34 estimated from pilot testing, for the critical t-test
of interest—the effect of production on false recognition. No participants took part in both experiments, and none had taken part in a previous production effect or DRM experiment from our laboratory.
Stimuli. The stimuli in the study phase consisted of ten DRM lists
that had been used in previous studies (e.g., Roediger & McDermott,
1995; see Stadler et al., 1999, for norms for DRM materials). Each DRM
list consisted of twelve words such as bed, rest, awake, and tired, all
related to a non-presented critical lure such as sleep. For each participant, five lists were presented in a color (red/blue) indicating “read
aloud” and the other five lists were presented in the other color indicating “read silently.” The assignment of both list and color to reading
condition, as well as the order of list presentation, was randomized for
each participant. Each word was presented in lowercase 30-pt Arial font
against a white background.
The recognition test list contained 80 words: 30 studied words (three

Once they indicated having understood these instructions, participants proceeded to the practice test consisting of four words from the
practice study phase, where they familiarized themselves with the
choice buttons. Then they proceeded to the 80-word recognition test
proper. Test words were presented with three clickable button
options—Old: Remember, Old: Know, and New—below the word. Each
word remained on the screen until the participant responded, and there
was a 500-ms blank screen between the response to one word and the
presentation of the next word. After completing the recognition test,
participants were thanked for their participation and debriefed.
Data Analysis. All analyses were conducted in R (R Core Team,
2022). ANOVAs were conducted using the afex package (Singmann
et al., 2023). We report Cohen’s dz as a measure of within-subject effect
size (using the standard deviation of the difference scores as the

significant, F(1,79) = 4.03, MSE = .02, p = .048, η2G = .005, indicating
that the production effect was somewhat larger for true recognition than
for false recognition.
We again conducted pre-registered paired t-tests separately for
studied words and for their critical lures, and the results were identical
to those of Experiment 1a. There was a significant production effect for
studied words, t(79) = 9.40, p < .001, dz = 1.05 [95 % CI: 0.73, 1.32]:
Reading aloud resulted in a higher true recognition rate than did reading
silently. There also was a significant production effect for their critical
lures, t(79) = 3.79, p < .001, dz = 0.42 [95 % CI: 0.19, 0.65]: Having
read DRM list words aloud resulted in a higher false recognition rate
than did having read them silently.

denominator; Cohen, 1988, p. 48), calculated using the effectsize package (Ben-Shachar et al., 2020). Data and analysis code for all experiments are available at https://osf.io/tjm2n/files.
Results
Experiment 1a was pre-registered at https://osf.io/j3a6g and
Experiment 1b at https://osf.io/whbax. The final sample for each
experiment included data from 80 participants. Six participants in
Experiment 1a and three in Experiment 1b had to be removed and
replaced due either to not following instructions, technical malfunctions, or scoring lower than the pre-registered criteria. Those participants who participated after the pre-registered sample size stopping rule
of 80 (one in Experiment 1a; nine in Experiment 1b) also were excluded
from analysis.

Familiarity and recollection with Remember/Know responses
Based on the Remember/Know responses, we calculated measures of
recollection and familiarity using the independent remember/know
method (Mangels et al., 2001; Ochsner, 2000; Ozubko et al., 2012a;
Yonelinas & Jacoby, 1995). It is important to keep in mind that unadjusted “know” responses underestimate the influence of familiarity. In
the remember/know procedure, participants are instructed to respond
“know” only if an item is familiar and they cannot recollect any details
surrounding it. In essence, then, as the proportion of “remember” responses increases, the proportion of “know” responses must necessarily
decrease. Therefore, if the raw proportion of “know” responses was
taken as a measure of familiarity, this would make it appear that the
influence of familiarity was decreasing, when in fact only recollection
was increasing. Consequently, because they are limited by the proportion of “remember” responses, “know” responses themselves do not
provide ideal measures of familiarity. In the independent remember/
know method, Recollection (R) is measured as the proportion of
“remember” responses; familiarity (F) is measured as the proportion of
“know” responses divided by the proportion of non–“remember” responses.4 Using this correction, researchers have demonstrated that estimates of recollection and familiarity, as measured in the remember/
know procedure, correspond with estimates of recollection and familiarity as measured by other techniques (Yonelinas, 2002; Yonelinas &
Jacoby, 1995; Yonelinas, 1997).
These estimates were calculated separately for each participant, both
for studied words (aloud or silently studied) and for their critical lures
(associated with either aloud or silently studied words). We then
analyzed these recollection and familiarity estimates using 2 X 2 X 2
repeated-measures ANOVAs, the factors being Reading Condition
(Aloud vs Silent), Word Type (Studied vs Critical Lure), and Response
Type (Recollection vs Familiarity). These analyses were followed by
two-way ANOVAs—2 (Reading Condition: Aloud vs Silent) X 2
(Response Type: Recollection vs Familiarity)— done separately for
studied words and for their critical lures. Table 1 presents the proportions of Recollection/Familiarity responses as a function of Reading
Condition and Word Type for Experiments 1a and 1b.
Experiment 1a. Despite the three-way interaction not being significant, F(1,79) = 1.30, MSE = .04, p = .258, η2G = .001, as pre-registered,
we conducted separate two-way ANOVAs for studied words and for
critical lures, the factors being Reading Condition (Aloud vs Silent) and
Response Type (Recollection vs Familiarity). For studied words, the
main effect of Reading Condition was significant, F(1,79) = 38.23, MSE
= .04, p < .001, η2G = .059, with reading aloud (M = .53, SE = .03)
resulting in more Recollection/Familiarity responses than reading
silently (M = .40, SE = .02). The main effect of Response Type was not
significant, F(1,79) = 0.33, MSE = .13, p = .566, η2G = .002, indicating
that the proportions of Recollection responses (M = .47, SE = .03) and of
Familiarity responses (M = .45, SE = .03) did not differ. However, the
interaction of Response Type with Reading Condition was significant,

True and false recognition rates
The recognition test was comprised of four stimulus types: 30 studied
words drawn from ten DRM lists, 10 critical lures associated with each of
the ten studied lists, and 40 unstudied words (30 unstudied list words
and their 10 unstudied critical lures). The overall false alarm rates for
the unstudied words were .18 (SE = .02) in Experiment 1a and .23 (SE =
.02) in Experiment 1b. Breaking these down further, false alarm rates for
the unstudied critical lures and for the unstudied list words (see Appendix) were, respectively, .23 and .16 in Experiment 1a, and .28 and
.21 in Experiment 1b. In each experiment, there was a small and
consistent false memory effect at test for the unstudied DRM lists: The
unstudied critical lures were incorrectly recognized as old more often
than were the unstudied list words, Experiment 1a: F(1,79) = 11.31,
MSE = .01, p = .001, η2G = .034; Experiment 1b: F(1,79) = 14.42, MSE =
.01, p < .001, η2G = .028.
Turning to the studied words, we begin simply, collapsing Old:
Remember and Old: Know responses into ‘old’ responses. These proportions are shown in Fig. 1 for actually studied DRM list words (hits)
and for their critical lures (critical false alarms) in both experiments. The
principal analysis was a 2 (Reading Condition: Aloud vs Silent) x 2
(Word Type: Studied vs Critical Lure) repeated-measures ANOVA, followed by separate paired t-tests for studied words and their critical lures.
Experiment 1a. There was a significant main effect of Reading Condition, F(1,79) = 75.09, MSE = .04, p < .001, η2G = .111, with more old
responses to words read aloud (M = .76, SE = .02) than to words read
silently (M = .60, SE = .03), the difference of .16 being a quite typical
production effect. There was also a significant main effect of Word Type,
F(1,79) = 22.46, MSE = 0.04, p < .001, η2G = .046, with more old responses to studied words (M = .73, SE = .02) than to critical lures (M =
.63, SE = .03), suggesting some discrimination. The interaction was not
significant, however, F(1,79) = 1.64, MSE = .03, p = .204, η2G = .003,
indicating roughly equivalent production effects for studied words and
for their critical lures.
We then conducted pre-registered paired t-tests separately for studied words and for their critical lures. For studied words, there was a
significant production effect, t(79) = 8.72, p < .001, dz = 0.97 [95 % CI:
0.71, 1.24]: Reading aloud resulted in a higher true recognition rate
than did reading silently. For critical lures, there also was a significant
production effect, t(79) = 4.57, p < .001, dz = 0.51 [95 % CI: 0.28,
0.74]: Having read DRM list words aloud resulted in a higher false
recognition rate for their critical lures than did having read list words
silently.
Experiment 1b. There was again a significant main effect of Reading
Condition, F(1,79) = 51.51, MSE = .04, p < .001, η2G = .105, with more
old responses to words read aloud (M = .72, SE = .03) than to words read
silently (M = .56, SE = .03), again a .16 production effect. There was also
a significant main effect of Word Type, F(1,79) = 14.43, MSE = .04, p =
.003, η2G = .031, with more old responses to studied words (M = .68, SE
= .02) than to their critical lures (M = .60, SE = .03), again suggesting
evidence of discrimination. This time, however, the interaction was

Fig. 1. Experiments 1a (left panel) and 1b (right panel): Mean proportions of ‘old’ responses to studied words (hits) and to critical lures (critical false alarms) in the
aloud and silent study conditions. Dashed lines are mean false alarm rates for the unstudied items; error bars are standard errors.

Experiment 1b. The three-way interaction again was not significant,
F(1,79) = 1.04, MSE = .05, p = .311, η2G = .001. As in Experiment 1a, and
in keeping with our pre-registration, we carried out separate two-way
ANOVAs for studied words and their critical lures. The results were
somewhat different from Experiment 1a. For studied words, the main
effect of Reading Condition was significant, F(1,79) = 79.44, MSE = .02,
p < .001, η2G = .098, with reading aloud (M = .50, SE = .03) resulting in
more Recollection/Familiarity responses than reading silently (M = .35,
SE = .04). The main effect of Response Type was also significant, F
(1,79) = 22.45, MSE = .10, p < .001, η2G = .114, indicating a higher
proportion of Familiarity responses (M = .50, SE = .03) than of Recollection responses (M = .34, SE = .03). The interaction of Response Type
with Reading Condition was not significant, F(1,79) = 0.16, MSE = .03,
p = .690, η2G < .001.
Turning to the critical lures, the main effect of Reading Condition
was significant, F(1,79) = 17.05, MSE = .04, p < .001, η2G = .023,
indicating that reading aloud (M = .40, SE = .04) resulted in a higher
proportion of Recollection/Familiarity responses than did reading
silently (M = .31, SE = .03). The main effect of Response Type was also
significant, F(1,79) = 26.71, MSE = .12, p < .001, η2G = .104, indicating a

Recollection responses (M = .25, SE = .03). The interaction was not
significant, F(1,79) = 0.74, MSE = .08, p = .392, η2G = .002.

F(1,79) = 7.00, MSE = .04, p = .010, η2G = .014. We followed up by
examining the effect of reading aloud separately on the proportions of
Recollection responses and of Familiarity responses. Relative to reading
silently, reading aloud resulted in a greater proportion of Recollection
responses, t(79) = 7.35, p < .001, dz = 0.77 [95 % CI: 0.54, 1.01], but
not of Familiarity responses, t(79) = 1.92, p = .058, dz = 0.24 [95 % CI:
− 0.01, 0.50].
Turning to the critical lures, the main effect of Reading Condition
was significant, F(1,79) = 22.13, MSE = .05, p < .001, η2G = .034, again
indicating that reading aloud (M = .45, SE = .04) resulted in a higher
proportion of Recollection/Familiarity responses than did reading
silently (M = .34, SE = .03). The main effect of Response Type was not
significant, F(1,79) = 3.30, MSE = .11, p = .073, η2G = .013, indicating
that the proportions of Recollection responses (M = .36, SE = .04) and of
Familiarity responses (M = .43, SE = .03) did not differ. The interaction
of Response Type with Reading Condition also was not significant, F
(1,79) = 0.70, MSE = .07, p = .404, η2G = .002.

Discussion
In two experiments, one conducted in the laboratory and one online,
we consistently found a robust production effect: Reading aloud resulted
in a higher recognition rate than did reading silently. We also obtained a
robust DRM effect: The critical lures for studied lists were falsely
recognized as having been presented at quite high rates (see Fig. 1).

Results

Additionally, we observed a small but significant DRM effect for the
unstudied items: The critical lures (e.g., doctor) from the unstudied lists
(e.g., nurse, health, patient) were falsely recognized at a higher rate than
were the other words from those lists that were presented only at test.
The critical lures of the unstudied lists may have been repeatedly cued
and activated as participants encountered the unstudied list words
during the recognition test (see also Coane & McBride, 2006). Overall,
these results clearly demonstrate that both our reading aloud and false
memory manipulations were successful.
Critically, we found that, relative to reading silently, reading aloud
increased not only true recognition rates but also false recognition rates.
That is, relative to reading silently, reading aloud resulted in a higher
proportion of ‘old’ responses both to words from the studied lists and to
critical lures from those same lists. However, this effect did not operate
differentially on Recollection vs. Familiarity responses (except in
Experiment 1a, where reading aloud was associated with a higher proportion of Remember responses for studied words). We also did not
replicate the finding of production leading to a greater increase in
recollection than in familiarity (Fawcett & Ozubko, 2016; Ozubko et al.,
2012a): Instead, production increased both recollection and familiarity
responses to both studied words and their critical lures. It is possible, of
course, that the semantically related structure of DRM lists is responsible
for this difference in pattern.
Clearly, our results are inconsistent with those of the two prior
related studies. Both Dodson and Schacter (2001, Experiment 2, N = 27)
and Culbreth and Putnam (2019, N = 73) manipulated production
within-subject and reported that reading the DRM list words aloud made
no difference in false recognition rates for their critical lures compared
either to having seen and heard the list words (Dodson & Schacter) or
having read the list words silently (Culbreth & Putnam) at study. Given
this difference in findings, and because of the different comparison
conditions in the prior studies, we conducted Experiment 2 in which we
compared reading words aloud to reading words silently while also
hearing them spoken by someone else—the comparison condition used
by Dodson and Schacter. Previous literature suggests that auditory
presentation of words is associated with higher rates of false memory
than is visual presentation (Smith & Hunt, 1998). Hence, one of the aims
of Experiment 2 was to examine whether reading aloud would result in
substantially different effects on false memory when compared to a
control condition where words were presented auditorily as well as
visually.

Experiment 2 was pre-registered at https://osf.io/swkaj.
True and false recognition rates
The overall false alarm rate for the unstudied items was .25 (SE =
.02). As in Experiments 1a and 1b, the false alarm rate was lower for
unstudied list words (.24) than for unstudied critical lures (.30), F(1,79)
= 20.41, MSE = .01, p < .001, η2G = .027, again showing a DRM effect at
test for unstudied materials.
As in Experiments 1a and 1b, we begin simply, collapsing Old:
Remember and Old: Know responses into ‘old’ responses. Fig. 2 shows
the proportions of ‘old’ responses to studied words and to their critical
lures as a function of reading condition. There was a significant main
effect of Reading Condition, F(1,79) = 35.29, MSE = .04, p < .001, η2G =
.088, with reading aloud (M = .76, SE = .02) resulting in greater
recognition than reading silently while hearing the printed words read
aloud (M = .62, SE = .03). The .14 production advantage is quite typical.
The main effect of Word Type was also significant, F(1,79) = 14.99, MSE
= .03, p < .001, η2G = .033, with participants responding old more often
to studied words (M = .73, SE = .02) than to their critical lures (M = .65,
SE = .03), demonstrating some discrimination. There also was a significant interaction, F(1,79) = 8.79, MSE = .02, p = .004, η2G = .011,
indicating that the effect of reading aloud was larger for true recognition
than for false recognition. Paired t-tests revealed significant production
effects both for true recognition of studied words, t(79) = 9.18, p < .001,
dz = 1.12 [95 % CI: 0.81, 1.43], and for false recognition of their critical
lures, t(79) = 2.70, p = .008, dz = 0.34 [95 % CI: 0.08, 0.59].
Familiarity and recollection with Remember/Know responses
As in Experiments 1a and 1b, we calculated Recollection and Familiarity estimates separately for each participant, for studied words
(aloud or silently studied) and for their critical lures (associated with
either aloud or silently studied words). Table 2 presents the proportions
of Recollection/Familiarity responses as a function of Reading Condition
and Word Type.
Although the three-way interaction was not significant, F(1,79) =
2.65, MSE = .04, p = .107, η2G = .002, in keeping with our preregistration, we followed up with separate planned two-way ANOVAs
for studied words and their critical lures, the factors being Reading
Condition (Aloud vs Silent) and Response Type (Remember vs Know).
For studied words, the main effect of Reading Condition was significant,
F(1,79) = 85.82, MSE = .03, p < .001, η2G = .133: Reading aloud (M =
.57, SE = .03) resulted in a higher proportion of Recollection/Familiarity responses than did reading silently and listening (M = .39, SE =
.02). The main effect of Response Type also was significant, F(1,79) =
9.49, MSE = .09, p = .003, η2G = .049, indicating a higher proportion of
Familiarity responses (M = .53, SE = .03) than of Recollection responses
(M = .43, SE = .03). The interaction was not significant, F(1,79) = 0.03,
MSE = .02, p = .855, η2G < .001.
For critical lures, the main effect of Reading Condition was
marginally significant, F(1,79) = 3.77, MSE = .06, p = .056, η2G = .008,
consistent with reading aloud (M = .43, SE = .04) resulting in a higher
proportion of Recollection/Familiarity responses than did reading
silently while listening (M = .37, SE = .03). The main effect of Response
Type was significant, F(1,79) = 14.58, MSE = .12, p < .001, η2G = .060,
indicating that there was a higher proportion of Familiarity responses
(M = .48, SE = .04) than of Recollection responses (M = .33, SE = .03).
The interaction was not significant, F(1,79) = 2.68, MSE = .07, p = .106,
η2G = .006.

Experiment 2
In Experiment 2, the only change was that the silent reading condition in Experiments 1a and 1b was replaced with a condition involving
silent reading and simultaneously hearing the words spoken by a
recorded voice. Experiment 2 was conducted online and was remotely
supervised.
Method
Participants. We chose a sample size of 80 to be consistent with
Experiments 1a and 1b. Participants were students from the University
of Waterloo participating online for course credit; none had taken part in
a previous production effect or DRM experiment from our laboratory.
None had to be replaced.
Stimuli. The DRM lists were those used in Experiments 1a and 1b.
Voice files were generated using the male-gendered “Alex” voice on a
Mac computer.
Procedure. Reading aloud was compared to reading silently while
hearing the words spoken by a male voice. This was the only procedural
difference compared to Experiment 1b: Both experiments were conducted online and were remotely supervised by an experimenter via web
camera.

Exploratory Analysis: Combined analysis for Familiarity and recollection
We conducted an exploratory combined analysis across Experiments
1a, 1b, and 2 because the numeric trends in Table 2 suggested that
production might increase recollection more than familiarity. Although
we did not find a significant interaction with reading condition in any

interaction remained non-significant, F(1,239) = 1.90, MSE = .03, p =

For critical lures, the main effect of Reading Condition was significant, F(1,239) = 36.48, MSE = .05, p < .001, η2G = .020, consistent with
reading aloud resulting in a higher proportion of Recollection/Familiarity responses than did reading silently or reading silently and
listening. The main effect of Response Type was significant, F(1,239) =
38.65, MSE = .12, p < .001, η2G = .051, indicating that there was a higher

larger effect on recollection, F(1,239) = 43.72, MSE = .04, p < .001, η2G
= .048, than on familiarity, F(1,239) = 4.34, MSE = .08, p = .038, η2G =
.006.

experiment, this combined analysis would provide more power to detect

Discussion
The change in the comparison condition—from silent reading in
Experiments 1a and 1b to hearing the words spoken by a recorded voice
while reading silently in Experiment 2—did not alter the pattern of results. Again, false recognition of the critical lures was greater following
reading aloud than following the comparison condition, just as was the
case for true recognition of the studied words. We also replicated the
finding from Experiments 1a and 1b that production was associated with
increases in both recollection-based and familiarity-based responses.
Experiment 3a
All three of our earlier reported experiments demonstrated that both
true recognition of the studied words and false recognition of the critical
lures were greater following reading aloud than following the comparison condition. As noted, this finding contradicts that of previous investigations that found no effect of reading aloud on false recognition
(Dodson & Schacter, 2001; Culbreth & Putnam, 2019).
Another potential point of difference was our use of the tripartite
Remember/Know/New procedure, in contrast to the two previous investigations that used a binary Old/New test. One potential concern was
that the one-step Remember/Know/New procedure tends to be associated with a more liberal response criterion (Hicks & Marsh, 1999),

leading to increased hit and false alarm rates, though we saw no reason
to anticipate that this would affect the aloud and silent conditions
differently in a within-subject design. Nevertheless, because our results
are the first demonstration of production increasing both hit and false
alarm rates, we saw it as important to establish that this effect generalized to the more common Old/New recognition test format. Thus, in
the following two experiments, we sought to replicate the basic pattern
of results with a binary recognition test.

Results
Experiment 3a was pre-registered at https://osf.io/xnzcv. The final
sample included data from 80 participants (64 women, 15 men, 1 undisclosed, M = 19.09 years, SD = 1.60). Seven participants had to be
removed and replaced due either to not following instructions, technical
malfunctions, or scoring lower than the pre-registered criteria. Finally,
five participants who participated after the pre-registered sample size
stopping rule of 80 were excluded from analysis.

Method

True and false recognition rates
The overall false alarm rate for the unstudied words was .19 (SE =
.04). As in previous experiments, the false alarm rate was lower for the
unstudied words (.18) than for their unstudied critical lures (.24), F
(1,79) = 14.85, MSE = .01, p < .001, η2G = .032, again showing a DRM
effect at test for unstudied materials.
Fig. 3 (left panel) shows the proportions of ‘old’ responses to presented words and to critical lures as a function of reading condition.
There was a significant main effect of Reading Condition, F(1,79) =
28.95, MSE = .04, p < .001, η2G = .077, with reading aloud (M = .76, SE
= .02) resulting in greater recognition than reading silently (M = .63, SE
= .02), a quite typical .13 production effect. The main effect of Word
Type was also significant, F(1,79) = 24.40, MSE = .03, p < .001, η2G =
.055, with participants responding old more often to studied words (M =
.75, SE = .01) than to their critical lures (M = .64, SE = .02), demonstrating some discrimination. These effects were qualified by a significant interaction, F(1,79) = 18.21, MSE = .02, p < .001, η2G = .030,

Experiment 3a constituted a replication of Experiment 1a with a
binary Old/New recognition test instead of a tripartite Remember/
Know/New recognition test.
Participants. We chose a sample size of 80, the same as earlier experiments. Participants were students from the University of Waterloo
participating for course credit; none had taken part in a previous production effect or DRM experiment from our laboratory.
Stimuli and Procedure. The DRM lists were the same as those used
in the previous experiments. The main procedural difference compared
to Experiment 1a was that the recognition test required participants to
respond with “Old” or “New” instead of with “Old: Remember,” “Old:
Know,” or “New.” Participants were also asked to self-report their age
and gender at the end of the experiment.

suggesting that the effect of reading aloud was larger for true recognition than for false recognition. Paired t-tests revealed a significant production effect for true recognition of studied words, t(79) = 8.90, p <
.001, dz = 0.99 [95 % CI: 0.72, 1.26], but not for false recognition of
their critical lures, t(79) = 1.40, p = .164, dz = 0.16 [95 % CI: − 0.06,
0.38].

Discussion
In Experiment 3a, as in the previous three experiments, we found a
main effect of production and an interaction with memory type, such
that we observed higher true recognition rates for the studied words that
had been read aloud. Unlike the previous experiments, however, reading
aloud did not result in a significant effect on false recognition of the
critical lures. One possibility is that the true influence of production on
false recognition is a null effect when a binary recognition test is used.
Another possibility is that our experiment was underpowered so that we
failed to detect the true effect of production. Thus, we conducted
Experiment 3b as a follow-up replication experiment with a larger
sample size that was determined after conducting a power analysis using
the estimates obtained from Experiment 3a.

SE = .01) resulting in greater recognition than reading silently (M = .57,

.016, with participants responding old more often to studied words (M =

effects were qualified by a significant interaction, F(1,299) = 70.97,
MSE = .02, p < .001, η2G = .025, indicating that the effect of reading

and for false recognition of their critical lures, t(299) = 5.13, p < .001,
dz = 0.30 [95 % CI: 0.18, 0.41].

Experiment 3b
Experiment 3b was a replication of Experiment 3a with a substantially larger sample size.

Discussion

Participants. We pre-registered a sample size of 300; Superpower’s
ANOVA_exact (Lakens & Caldwell, 2021) deemed this N to be sufficient
for .80 power to detect a production effect in the critical lures (Maloud =
67, Msilent = .62, SD = .26, r = .30; estimates from Experiment 3a).
Participants were recruited from Prolific (https://www.prolific.com/)
and paid GB £1.88; none had taken part in a previous production effect
or DRM experiment from our laboratory.
Stimuli and Procedure. The DRM lists were the same as those used
in the previous experiments. Experiment 3b was conducted remotely on
Prolific; participants were audio-recorded during the study phase so that
we could check for adherence to the reading instructions.

In Experiment 3b, we again found a main effect of production and an
interaction with memory type: Reading aloud resulted in higher true
recognition rates for studied words and in higher false recognition rates
for their associated critical lures, with the latter effect being smaller than
the former. A combined analysis (see Supplementary Materials) of the
data from Experiments 3a and 3b indicated that the effect of production
on false recognition was small but robust. Table 4 presents the mean
proportions of ‘Old’ responses combining the data of Experiments 3a and
3b, along with the comparable proportions from Experiments 1a, 1b,
and 2 (collapsing Old:Remember and Old:Know responses). Clearly, the
tripartite test and the binary test procedures led to virtually identical
outcomes, indicating that the tripartite test did not lead to inflated hit
and false alarm rates.

Results

General Discussion

Experiment 3b was pre-registered at https://osf.io/eg84a. The final
sample included data from 300 participants (169 women, 127 men, 3
gender nonconforming, 1 undisclosed, M = 40.70 years, SD = 12.98).
Forty-one other participants had to be removed and replaced due either
to not following instructions, technical malfunctions, or scoring lower
than the pre-registered criteria. Finally, three participants who participated after the pre-registered sample size stopping rule of 300 were
excluded from analysis.

Across multiple experiments (total N = 620), we have seen a thoroughly consistent pattern: False recognition of critical unstudied lures
was amplified by having studied the list words aloud rather than silently—or silently and aurally. This was the same amplification as was
consistently found for true recognition—for words that were actually
read aloud during study— although the increase in false recognition was
consistently found to be significantly smaller than that for true
recognition.
As noted in the introduction, neither the pure distinctiveness account
nor the pure strength account would appear to fully explain the current
results. In the relative distinctiveness account (e.g., Conway & Gathercole, 1987; MacLeod & Bodner, 2017), the additional features associated with the act of production (relative to the silent condition)
provide a basis for a recollection boost during retrieval. Computational
modeling tends to capture this by storing in memory additional features
for produced items, which can be thought of as perceptual/motoric
features associated with the act of producing an item (Cyr et al., 2022;
Jamieson et al., 2016; Kelly et al., 2022). Given that the critical lures

unstudied words (.20) than for their unstudied critical lures (.25),
F(1,299) = 39.17, MSE = .01, p < .001, η2G = .016, again showing a DRM

were not encoded with distinctive produced features, the distinctiveness
account would expect it to be easier to reject critical lures. However, we
instead found an increase in false alarm rates for the critical lures
associated with the produced words. This is at odds with a pure
distinctiveness account that would predict a primarily recollectionbased increase in true recognition for the words spoken aloud, but a
decrease in false recognition. The pure memory strength account (e.g.,
Bodner & Taikh, 2012; Fawcett & Ozubko, 2016) is also insufficient, as
we did not find the effect of production on false recognition to be primarily due to familiarity. Instead, in Experiments 1a, 1b, and 2, production increased recollection and familiarity responses for both true
and false recognition (if anything, our results suggested potentially a
greater boost for recollection over familiarity).
The upshot is that each of these theoretical accounts of production
appears to be incomplete: In Experiments 1a, 1b, and 2, reading aloud
did not selectively boost familiarity-based false memory nor did it
selectively increase memory for the distinctive produced features in a
way that made recollection rejection easier. Instead, we observed
increased rates of “phantom recollection” (Brainerd et al., 2001; Brainerd et al., 2003) for the critical lures associated with the words studied
aloud, although this increase due to production was less than that
observed for the studied words themselves.
How do our findings fit with the theoretical accounts of false
recognition? In activation monitoring theory (e.g., Roediger et al.,
2001), increased false recognition arises from a high level of activation
of the critical lure, which is predominantly based on the semantic information that is repeatedly cued by the list words during study.
Furthermore, if a critical lure becomes strongly activated during study, it
can also become associated with the study context (Roediger et al.,
2001; Roediger et al., 2004). In global matching models, false recognition occurs due to high similarity between the critical lure and a
multitude of encoded memory traces (Arndt, 2010), and similarity can
be based on item/semantic information as well as contextual information. In fuzzy trace theory (e.g., Reyna & Brainerd, 1995) false recognition largely depends on gist (semantic and contextual) traces rather
than on verbatim (item-specific) traces. Although they differ in some
assumptions, all three frameworks account for false memory phenomena
via a semantic activation-based process (i.e., spreading activation,
global matching, gist trace). In the following sections, we will emphasize
fuzzy-trace theory because it provides the most articulate distinction
between non-semantic item information, semantic information, and
context information (Brainerd et al., 2014).
Within fuzzy trace theory, false memories are thought to stem primarily from the retrieval of gist (semantic) traces in memory, whereas
true memories can be based on the retrieval of either (or both) of gist
traces and verbatim traces. Retrieval of verbatim traces should increase
true memory and potentially suppress (via recollection rejection) false
memories; in sharp contrast, retrieval of gist traces should increase false
memories. Our principal result—that production led to an increase in
false memory (albeit to a lesser extent than was evident for true memory)—suggests increases in both verbatim-based and gist-based
retrieval. That we observed enhancement, not suppression, of false
memories additionally suggests that the influence on false memory of
the gist traces outweighed that of the verbatim traces.
A gist-based account may appear at first blush to contradict our
observation in Experiments 1a, 1b, and 2 of a production-associated
increase in both recollection and familiarity responses across both true
and false memory. However, the distinction between gist and verbatim
traces does not map directly onto recollection and familiarity. Brainerd
et al. (2014) argue that there are two types of recollection: recollection
of the target items themselves and recollection of their contextual details. This distinction between item information and context information
goes back to McGeoch (1932), and can also be seen in computational
models of memory (e.g., Polyn et al., 2009; also the item vs. associative
information distinction in TODAM2; Murdock, 1993). Contextual information includes such features as when or where an item was

presented and the conditions (internal/external) present when the item
was encoded.
In the fuzzy trace account, false recognition is thought to be suppressed by target recollection but increased by contextual recollection
(Brainerd et al., 2014). Context recollection can be based on retrieval of
verbatim and/or gist traces (because both are episodically tagged), but
target item recollection should only be based on the retrieval of
verbatim traces (i.e., retrieval of item-specific information). In other
words, gist traces can be expected to support contextual recollection
(which increases false memory), but not target recollection (which
suppresses false memory). Familiarity, on the other hand, occurs when
gist traces are retrieved without stored contextual details coming to
mind (Brainerd et al., 2014). Therefore, a production-associated increase in gist would be expected to enhance context recollection as well
as familiarity but not to influence target recollection.
Production, gist, and context
The current pattern of results, where production increased recollection and familiarity responses in both true and false recognition, is
consistent with production-related enhancement of semantic and/or
contextual gist. Zhou and MacLeod (2022) have previously argued that
production constitutes an additional kind of contextual information (i.e.,
a kind of condition present for some items during encoding). The
distinctive produced features establish a global contextual cue that is
associated only with the produced items (from the participant’s point of
view, the context can be considered to be “items that were studied
aloud”). The current results fit well with the Zhou and MacLeod
contextual account of production whereby the distinctive produced
features establish a global contextual cue that becomes associated with
the produced items and consequently, in the present case, with their
associated critical lures.
Another possibility (that does not preclude the first) is that the effect
of production as observed on false recognition is based on increased
semantic activation. Fawcett et al. (2022, Experiment 2) have provided
converging evidence that production enhances semantic processing.
Following a standard production paradigm study phase, Fawcett et al.
administered a two-alternative forced-choice recognition test. When the
lure was a synonym of a target word, rather than being unrelated, the
production effect was reliably reduced. Coupled with their Experiment 1
finding that homophone lures did not reduce the effect, they suggested
(p. 2261) “that items read aloud are distinctive not only due to the inclusion of sensorimotor elements, but also because the act of production
encourages broader conceptual encoding.” Greater false recognition for
the better-remembered aloud lists than for the silent lists likely is the
consequence of greater priming of the critical lures. Such priming would
necessarily be semantic, given the associative structure of DRM lists and
their critical lures.
We note that these two possibilities—semantic retrieval and context
retrieval—are likely to co-occur and have been documented in theoretical accounts of false memory. In activation-monitoring theory, the
critical lure becomes associated with the same context as the studied
words because of strong semantic-based activation during the original
encoding context. Thus, production may have increased semantic processing, such that critical lures associated with the produced items may
also have become associated with a produced context, leading to more
false recognition. These processes presumably outweighed any effect
that production may have had on target item (non-contextual verbatim
information) recollection given that our participants were less successful
at rejecting the critical lures associated with the produced items.
Comparison of current results with previous literature
Our results—that reading aloud was associated with greater false
alarms to critical lures—contradict those reported by Dodson and
Schacter (2001) and by Culbreth and Putnam (2019). Both of those

studies reported no effect on false recognition of whether the list words
had been studied aloud, doing so with respect to different comparison
conditions—silent reading with simultaneous hearing of recorded
speaking (Dodson & Schacter) or simply silent reading (Culbreth &
Putnam).5 In Experiments 1a, 1b, 3a, and 3b, we used the silent reading
comparison condition typical of production effect studies; in Experiment
2, we used the silent reading with concurrent hearing comparison condition. Overall, we had considerably increased power than the prior
studies and we demonstrated very consistent replicability of our patterns. Given the power and replication in our study, we see our experiments as providing the most complete picture with respect to false
recognition resulting from production. Additionally, our use of the
Remember/Know/New procedure in Experiments 1a, 1b, and 2 also
allowed us to dissociate production’s effects on recollection and familiarity in both true and false recognition.

material. This makes sense given that the lists in prior studies consisted
of unrelated words. Presumably, saying those words aloud enhanced
verbatim traces. We saw this benefit again here for the studied words.
But we have shown that production also has a “dark side”: It simultaneously increases the likelihood of false recognition of semantically
related information, presumably because that information matches the
gist trace of what was actually studied. Reading aloud leads to enhanced
memory for meaning or for context, or both, which in turn provides the
basis both for accurately remembering the items presented in a list and
for falsely remembering unstudied associated items as having been
studied.

Theoretical and practical significance

CRediT authorship contribution statement

Although both the production effect and the DRM effect are well
established in the literature, our experiments provide a considerably
clearer picture of their relation than has been available to date. The
obtained pattern of results, that reading aloud was associated with
greater false memory rates as well as with greater true memory rates,
clarifies the mechanisms underlying how reading aloud influences
memory. Instead of a distinctiveness/global strength dichotomy, we
posit that fuzzy trace theory in particular may be a promising framework
for understanding the effects of production on memory for semantic gist,
contextual gist, and verbatim detail. Based on the current results, we
have suggested that reading aloud enhances memory for semantic gist
and/or context in particular. Future research might explore this hypothesis further by examining how reading aloud can influence memory
for context (e.g., source memory).
In terms of broader practical significance, our results may have implications in such domains as the legal field—for example, asking eyewitnesses to orally retrieve their memories may potentially increase the
risk of unwanted false recall and hence of erroneous testimony (see also
Loftus, 1996). While practical settings such as these clearly differ from
the experimentally controlled, within-subject presentation of words
explored here, this is certainly an empirical question that warrants
further research.

There were, of course, small procedural differences between their studies and ours, including different presentation durations (3 s for D & S; 2 s for C & P; 2.5 s for
us), different numbers of studied lists (16 for Dodson & Schacter, 2001; 12 for Culbreth & Putnam, 2019; 10 for us), different numbers of words per list (15 for D & S;
10 for C & P; 12 for us), and different numbers of test items (96 for D & S; 72 for C & P; 80 for us). The D & S study likely suffered from the noise inherent in small
samples, whereas the C & P study may have been less sensitive than ours due to using shorter lists and fewer test items; of course, it may simply reflect a Type II error.
