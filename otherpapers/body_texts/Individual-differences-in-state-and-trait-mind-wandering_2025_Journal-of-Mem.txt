Peterson & Wissman, 2020; see also Smallwood et al., 2007).
To measure mind-wandering, researchers employ various assessment
methods (see Kane et al., 2021). One common approach involves the use
of thought probes where participants are asked to report their conscious
experiences during an ongoing task (e.g., Weinstein, 2018). These
thought probes are typically interspersed within a subset of primary task
trials and researchers can adjust the frequency and interval between
probes (Robison et al., 2019). Again, higher rates of self-reported mindwandering in response to these thought probes are often associated with
poorer performance on the primary task (McVay & Kane, 2009; Miller &
Castel, 2024; Unsworth & McMillan, 2014). Thus, mind-wandering is
generally detrimental to cognitive performance.
Prior research has applied thought probes and other techniques to
measure mind-wandering during the learning of verbal materials (see

Blondé et al., 2022 for a review). For example, Smallwood et al. (2003)
measured mind-wandering via thought probes where participants were
asked to report exactly what was passing through their mind upon
hearing a buzzer sound, classifying their thoughts as task-related
thought, task-related interference, and task-unrelated thought. Simi­
larly, Peterson and Wissman (2020) had one categorical thought probe
after each list of studied words. Furthermore, Xu and Metcalfe (2016)
periodically asked participants throughout their study sessions whether
they were focused on the task or if their minds were wandering.
Importantly, in these studies using verbal memory paradigms, a negative
association is consistently shown between mind-wandering and memory
performance (the number of words a participant can recall). Despite
these insights, Blondé et al. (2022) indicate that most of the previous
research on mind-wandering and memory has focused primarily on
average recall performance, leaving room for further exploration into
the complexities of recall dynamics and how mind-wandering influences
both encoding and retrieval processes in more nuanced ways. Addi­
tionally, this prior work has some limitations such as small sample sizes,
a lack of focus on individual differences, and primarily examining state
mind-wandering rather than differentiating between state and trait
mind-wandering.
State and trait are terms commonly used in psychology to describe
different aspects of an individual’s moment-to-moment fluctuations
versus stable characteristics, respectively. Specifically, state refers to a
temporary or transient mental or emotional condition—states can be
influenced by various factors such as the environment, mood, specific
circumstances, or immediate experiences. For example, feeling anxious
before an important presentation or being happy after receiving good
news are both examples of states. Trait, on the other hand, refers to a
stable and enduring characteristic that remains relatively constant over
time and across situations. For instance, someone who is consistently
optimistic or introverted across various contexts is exhibiting traits. The
distinction between states and traits can be conceptualized within
classical test theory, and psychometric advancements have been made in
estimating momentary intraindividual variability in an individual’s
trait-based behaviors (Steyer et al., 1999, 2015).
In the context of mind-wandering and learning, “state mind-wan­
dering” refers to the frequency with which a participant experiences the
temporary and momentary occurrences of the mind drifting away from
encoding the to-be-remembered information. Thought probes during the
study phase can capture real-time mind-wandering (e.g., Feng et al.,
2013), allowing for an examination of how the state of mind of a learner
during encoding relates to memory performance. On the other hand, to
quantitatively measure trait levels of mind-wandering, Mrazek et al.
(2013) developed the Mind-Wandering Questionnaire (MWQ). This fivequestion scale assesses an individual’s tendency to mind-wander in daily
life, offering a standardized method for investigating trait-level mindwandering.
Prior work has investigated the relationship between state and trait
mind wandering. For example, Seli et al. (2016) assessed whether in­
dividual propensities for trait mind wandering (measured via selfreports) correspond to state-level occurrences recorded using thought
probes. Results revealed that individuals’ self-reported habitual mindwandering tendencies (trait) often reflect their immediate mindwandering behavior (state). Similarly, Da Silva et al. (2020) investi­
gated the relationship between state and trait levels of mind wandering
during a tracing task. They demonstrated that people who generally
mind-wander more frequently tended to experience more diverse
thoughts and perform differently, but these trait differences did not
predict perceptual decoupling (the degree of disengagement from the
external environment) or mental navigation (the movement of thoughts
across time and space) during the task. Thus, while general mindwandering tendencies (trait) can influence momentary experiences
(state), different dimensions of mind-wandering may have distinct cor­
relates and effects on cognitive performance. While certainly associated,
prior work has shown that trait and state measures of other

psychological constructs show convergent and discriminant validity and
we expect similar findings with trait and state estimates of mind wan­
dering (Zuckerman, 1983).
Although similar, state and trait mind-wandering are separate con­
structs, each influencing cognitive processes in distinct ways. For
example, someone with a low propensity for mind-wandering may
experience episodes of mind-wandering under certain conditions such as
high stress or fatigue. Conversely, an individual characterized as a high
trait mind-wanderer may not always be mind-wandering, especially in
contexts that capture their interest or require focused attention. Addi­
tionally, the mechanisms through which state and trait mind-wandering
affect learning could differ. Specifically, trait mind-wandering might
influence memory via a general tendency towards less effective encod­
ing strategies or poorer maintenance of goal-directed activity. On the
other hand, state mind-wandering might impact memory through more
immediate mechanisms such as momentary lapses in attention that lead
to gaps in encoding (which would be reflected in retrieval patterns such
as lag-conditional response probabilities). Thus, even though a higher
frequency of mind-wandering instances is associated with the trait, the
specific impact of each instance (state mind-wandering) and how this
accumulates or interacts with an individual’s baseline propensity can
provide deeper insights into the relationship between mind-wandering
and memory.
Another reason mind-wandering may be detrimental to episodic
memory processes is a reduction in the consistency and intensity of
attention, each representing separable components that reflect distinct
aspects of cognitive engagement and regulation (Unsworth & Miller,
2021). Consistency involves how regularly attention is maintained across
repeated trials of a task, reflecting the ability to avoid attentional lapses.
On the other hand, intensity represents the amount of attentional effort
directed toward a specific task. Better learners not only deploy greater
attentional effort but also maintain this focus consistently throughout
encoding, thereby avoiding frequent shifts in attention during the
learning process (Miller & Unsworth, 2020, 2021; Unsworth & Miller,
2021). These components of attention are associated with state mindwandering (Robison & Brewer, 2022), likely impacting overall mem­
ory performance and potentially retrieval dynamics as well.
Individuals prone to mind-wandering (trait) may exhibit poorer
attentional consistency, experiencing more frequent lapses in attention
during encoding. Additionally, when the mind wanders during encoding
(state), the temporary reduction in the intensity of attention likely im­
pairs subsequent memory performance. Specifically, when the mind is
wandering, attention is diverted to task-unrelated thoughts rather than
engaging in encoding strategies such as generating mental images of the
items of creating sentences to link the words together in a meaningful
way. Thus, trait mind-wanderers may be “inconsistent” with their
attention, leading to more frequent states of mind-wandering and poorer
memory performance due to a reduction in the intensity of attention.
This cost of mind-wandering may particularly impair a learner’s ability
to bind temporal-contextual information that can later be used as a cue
to benefit retrieval.
Most prior work on mind-wandering and learning has focused pri­
marily on overall memory performance—demonstrating worse recall
when participants mind-wandered—without delving into the dynamics
of how items are retrieved (Blondé et al., 2022). A key aspect of memory
retrieval is the use of internal context such as temporal, semantic, and
source elements that guide the sequence of retrieval (Polyn et al., 2009).
One specific measure that captures this process is the lag-recency effect
which refers to the tendency to recall items that were encoded in close
temporal proximity together. Specifically, the lag-recency effect illus­
trates how temporal context can serve as a cue during recall, often
leading to the retrieval of items in the order they were presented (e.g.,
Sederberg et al., 2010). There are important individual differences in the
lag-recency effect such as learners with lower working memory capacity
struggling to use the products of retrieval to aid their search (Spillers &
Unsworth, 2011), and these differences may be partly attributable to the
2

D.H. Murphy and G.A. Brewer

tendency of individuals with lower cognitive abilities to engage in mindwandering more frequently. Examining the lag-recency effect in the
context of mind-wandering can provide deeper insights into how state
and trait mind-wandering influence memory processes. State mindwandering may disrupt the encoding of temporal-contextual cues,
thereby weakening the lag-recency effect. In contrast, trait mindwandering might have a more pervasive impact on overall cognitive
strategies and memory organization, potentially leading to different
retrieval patterns.
Prior work has suggested that conditions involving incidental
encoding or very long lists, which can be boring, reduce the contiguity
effect (Hong et al., 2023; Mundorf et al., 2021). This is closely related to
the idea that mind-wandering impairs attention to context cues (i.e.,
attentional lapses can disrupt the encoding of temporal-contextual in­
formation) thereby diminishing the lag-recency effect. Thus, variations
in levels of attention at encoding may influence the effectiveness of
temporal-contextual cues in guiding memory retrieval. When a learner’s
mind wanders, their attention may shift away from the sequential pre­
sentation of items, disrupting the encoding process. Consequently, the
temporal context of a given item may not be adequately encoded or
integrated into memory and learners may struggle to establish the
necessary associations between adjacent items, weakening the forwardordered recall pattern typical of the lag-recency effect.
While the order in which an item was presented often plays a crucial
role in its successful recall, numerous other predictable patterns have
been observed. Notably, in free recall paradigms, learners tend to
initiate their output with either the first or last item from a list
(measured by the probability of first recall, PFR; Howard & Kahana,
1999; Kahana et al., 2002). This tendency to initiate recall with the first
or last item is particularly pronounced in immediate free recall tests
where the last item presented is more likely to be recalled first.
Conversely, during delayed free recall, when rehearsal opportunities are
interrupted after the final word’s presentation, the first studied word
tends to be the first recalled. In the current study, we aim to better our
understanding of how involuntary shifts in attention as well as the
predisposition towards mind-wandering affect retrieval initiation and
other memory retrieval dynamics.

the memory task, participants were asked to rate how often their minds
wandered during the task on a scale of 0 (never) to 100 (very
frequently)—we refer to this as retrospective mind-wandering. Finally,
participants completed the Mind-Wandering Questionnaire (Mrazek
et al., 2013) to assess trait-level mind-wandering tendencies. Since
mind-wandering typically disrupts memory, we expected participants
with a greater propensity to mind-wander to demonstrate impaired
overall episodic memory performance and display different retrieval
transition tendencies and recall initiation patterns.
Method
Participants. After exclusions, participants were 205 undergraduate
students (Mage = 19.81, SDage = 3.25; 117 female, 86 male, 1 other, 1
chose not to report) recruited from the Arizona State University (ASU)
Human Subjects Pool. In each experiment, participants were tested on­
line, received course credit for their participation, and were excluded
from analysis if they admitted to cheating (e.g., writing down answers)
in a post-task questionnaire (they were told they would still receive
credit if they cheated). This exclusion process resulted in seven exclu­
sions. Participants were also excluded if they did not attest to giving
their best effort on the task. This exclusion criterion resulted in no ex­
clusions. In the present experiments, we aimed for a sample size of 200
participants which approaches the threshold for stable estimates of
correlations as indicated by Schönbrodt and Perugini (2013), ensuring
reliable and accurate measurement of our variables.
Materials. The words on each list were randomly selected from a
pool of 689 unrelated words (e.g., button, chart, twig) that were be­
tween 4 and 7 letters (M = 4.85, SD = .98). On the log-transformed
Hyperspace Analogue to Language frequency scale (with lower values
indicating lower frequency in the English language and higher values
indicating higher frequency), words ranged from 4.73 to 14.35 (M =
9.48, SD = 1.57). In terms of concreteness (with lower values indicating
lower concreteness and higher values indicating higher concreteness),
words ranged from 1.19 to 5.00 (M = 4.16, SD = .84). Frequency and
concreteness ratings were generated using the English Lexicon Project
website (Balota et al., 2007). Words are available on OSF.
Procedure. At the beginning of the task, participants were asked to
1) be prepared to complete the study in a single, 60-minute session (i.e.,
no prolonged breaks), (2) complete this study in an environment with
minimal distraction (i.e., put away extra devices, close unneeded tabs,
and turn off any music or TV in the background), (3) complete the study
on a laptop or desktop computer (i.e., do NOT use a mobile phone or a
tablet), and (4) if in the presence of other people, try to move somewhere
more secluded. Participants were then told: “Please give your full effort
on this task! PLEASE do not use any external aides and thus use ONLY
YOUR OWN memory to complete the study.” Next, participants were
told: “This task will be very difficult. We do not expect you to remember
everything; you will likely only be able to remember some of the in­
formation. Please do not cheat by taking pictures of the screen, writing
things down, or using any other aid to complete this task.” Finally, we
again asked participants that they do not cheat on this task by using any
memory aids and that they give their full effort on this task. They then
had to attest whether they would not cheat and whether they would give
their best effort.
Participants were then presented with lists of 10 unrelated words to
remember for a later test. Participants studied each word for 2 s and after
the presentation of all words, participants completed a 30-second
distraction task requiring them to rearrange the digits of several threedigit numbers in descending order (e.g., 123 would be rearranged to
321). Participants were given 3 s to view each of the 10 three-digit
numbers and subsequently rearrange the digits. Following the dis­
tractor task, participants were asked to recall all the words they could
remember from the just-studied list. Participants were given 1 min to
recall the words and were asked to try to continue to recall words
throughout the entire minute. Participants recalled words by typing

The current study
In the current study, we explored the potential relations between
mind-wandering tendencies and episodic memory performance in a
multi-trial delayed free recall paradigm. Specifically, we investigated
the impact of both state and trait mind-wandering on recall accuracy,
the lag-recency effect, and the probability of first recall. We were
particularly interested in understanding whether the occurrence of
mind-wandering, both in the moment (state) and as a more stable
characteristic (trait), could differentially influence the temporal binding
of information during encoding and the subsequent memory retrieval
dynamics. We employed mind-wandering probes throughout a word list
learning task as well as a separate mind-wandering questionnaire (at the
end of the task) to measure state and trait mind-wandering, respectively.
We hypothesized that individuals more prone to mind-wandering would
exhibit lower levels of average recall, a diminished ability to effectively
utilize temporal-contextual cues, and differ in their recall initiation
strategies.
Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, participants were presented with 30 lists, each
containing 10 words shown for 2 s each. Participants then completed a
30-second distractor task before a 1-minute free recall test. Once per list,
at pseudo-random serial positions, participants responded to mindwandering probes. These probes were used to compute the proportion
of the time that participants were mind-wandering (state mindwandering). As an additional mind-wandering measure, at the end of
3

them into an on-screen text box—recalled words remained on the
screen. Responses were scored using a similarity-based algorithm that
calculates the percentage match between participants’ responses and the
correct answers. To account for typographical errors, we applied a le­
niency criterion, setting the threshold for correctness at 75 % similarity.
For example, a response such as ‘aple’ for ‘apple’ would meet the 75 %
threshold and be counted as correct, while ‘apl’ would not. Full details
are available on OSF. This was repeated for a total of 30 study-test
cycles.
Once per list (occurring at pseudo-random serial positions), partici­
pants were asked about their level of attentiveness. Specifically, par­
ticipants were asked to characterize their current conscious experience;
participants indicated whether they were either a) totally focused on the
current task (i.e., paying attention to the word pairs and trying to learn
them), b) thinking about their performance on the task or how long it is
taking (i.e., whether they will remember the information but also
wondering whether the task will end soon), c) distracted by information
present in the room (e.g., sights and sounds), d) zoning out/mindwandering (i.e., their attention has shifted away from the task to selfgenerated thoughts unrelated to the task), or e) “Other” (taken from
Unsworth & McMillan, 2014). Responses to the mind-wandering probes
were self-paced.
At the end of the last list, participants were asked: “Please rate how
often your mind wandered during this task (when your thoughts wander
away from what you are doing and go somewhere else on their own) on a
scale of 0 to 100 (0 = never, 100 = very frequently)”—these ratings
formed the retrospective mind-wandering rate. Finally, participants
completed the Mind-Wandering Questionnaire developed by Mrazek
et al. (2013). Specifically, using a scale from 0 to 100 (0 = never, 100 =
very frequently), participants responded to the following questions: 1) I
have difficulty maintaining focus on simple or repetitive work, 2) While
reading, I find I have not been thinking about the text and must therefore
read it again, 3) I do things without paying full attention, 4) I find myself
listening with one ear, thinking about something else at the same time,
and 5) I mind-wander during lectures of presentations. Responses on this
questionnaire were used to measure trait mind-wandering, which was
computed as the average rating across the five questions.
Data Availability. The materials, data, and information needed to
reproduce the analyses are available on OSF.
Reliabilities. To examine the reliability of participants’ mindwandering rates, we compared the mind-wandering rate for even and
odd lists for each participant [Cronbach’s α = .95]. Reliability cannot be
computed for retrospective mind-wandering because there was only one
response for each participant. To examine the reliability of the trait
mind-wandering questionnaire, we compared participants’ responses to
each of the five questions [Cronbach’s α = .81]. Finally, we examined
the reliability of participants’ recall across the 30 lists [Cronbach’s α =
.96].

Next, we investigated the relationship between mind-wandering and
recall performance (see Fig. 1, bottom panel). Pearson correlations
revealed that recall was negatively related to the mind-wandering rate
during the task [r = -.49, p < .001], retrospective mind-wandering
ratings, [r = -.45, p < .001], and trait mind-wandering [r = -.29, p <
.001]. Given that all measures of mind-wandering were related (nega­
tively) to recall, we also examined whether each measure of mindwandering uniquely predicts memory. A General Linear Model with
mind-wandering rate during the task (state mind-wandering), retro­
spective mind-wandering ratings, and trait mind-wandering scores
predicting average memory performance (R2 = .28) revealed that mindwandering rate [β = -.35, t(201) = -4.67, p < .001] and retrospective
mind-wandering [β = -.21, t(201) = -2.55, p = .012] both uniquely
predicted memory performance but trait mind-wandering did not [β =
-.07, t(201) = -.96, p = .338].
We next examined how mind-wandering rate and recall changed as
the task endured (see Fig. 2). A mixed multi-level model with list-level
recall accuracy (the proportion of items recalled on a given list)
modeled as a function of list (continuous variable nested within indi­
vidual participants) revealed that recall decreased as the task endured [t
(5944) = -18.22, p < .001]. A similar model with mind-wandering on
each list revealed that mind-wandering increased as the task endured [t
(5836) = 28.66, p < .001].
In addition to overall memory performance, we wanted to analyze
the lag-recency effect to gain a deeper understanding of how mindwandering influences the temporal dynamics of memory retrieval and
the use of contextual cues during recall. Lag conditional-response
probabilities (lag-CRPs) can be used to quantitatively measure the lagrecency effect (see Kahana, 1996). Specifically, lag-CRPs provide a
means of assessing how individuals transition between recalling items
during memory retrieval. Since items presented in close temporal
proximity share more contextual features, the retrieval of one item can
act as a cue to retrieve nearby items, thus increasing the likelihood of
recalling items with shorter temporal lags (Sederberg et al., 2010;
Spillers & Unsworth, 2011). As a result, participants tend to demonstrate
increased CRPs for adjacent items compared to items that are more
distantly separated in the encoding sequence.
The CRP for a recall transition is calculated by dividing the sum of
the number of times a specific lag transition occurred by the total
number of times that transition could have been made. Lag refers to the
ordinal space between serial positions, such as the lag between serial
positions 8 and 9 being 1. For instance, if an individual recalls an item
presented in serial position 8, the CRP for a lag of 1 would represent the
probability that the item in serial position 8 is recalled immediately after
the item in serial position 7 or 9, rather than items further away like 6 or
10 (illustrating a lag of 2). Lag-CRPs not only provide valuable insights
into participants’ recall patterns, but they also show a positive rela­
tionship with elevated task performance (Sederberg et al., 2010; Spillers
& Unsworth, 2011). This suggests that the effective use of temporalcontextual cues, derived from just-recalled words, facilitates the
retrieval of additional words during memory recall, leading to enhanced
performance in memory tasks.
The probability of recalling an item from serial position x followed
by an item from serial position y for lags 1–5 (the most relevant for
visualization) split into quartiles based on mind-wandering rate/state

Results
To examine mind-wandering rates, we first coded participants’ re­
sponses to the mind-wandering probes as either mind-wandering
(distracted by information present in the room (sights and sounds)
and zoning out/mind-wandering) or not mind-wandering (totally
focused on the current task and thinking about their performance on the
task or how long it is taking); “Other” responses were not considered
mind-wandering or not mind-wandering. We then computed the pro­
portion of the time participants indicated that they were mindwandering. An examination of the Pearson correlations between our
measures of mind-wandering (see Fig. 1, top panel) revealed that the
mind-wandering rate during the task (state mind-wandering) was
related to retrospective mind-wandering ratings [r = .60, p < .001] as
well as trait mind-wandering [r = .35, p < .001]; additionally, retro­
spective mind-wandering ratings were related to trait mind-wandering
[r = .51, p < .001].

mind-wandering for each participant (predictors are nested within each
participant) predicting CRPs—all mind-wandering measures were
treated as continuous variables.1 For simplicity, the results are reported
in Table 1. As per Cohen et al. (2013), when there is a continuous var­
iable interaction, researchers can use plots with quartiles for interpre­
tation. Here, in terms of the critical three-way interactions, we only
observed a significant three-way interaction between lag, direction, and
mind-wandering when considering trait mind-wandering. Thus, the lagrecency effect appears to be particularly hindered in trait mindwanderers such that their ability to recall adjacent items in the for­
ward direction was impaired.2
We were also interested in how mind-wandering impacts the lagrecency effect as the task endures and mind-wandering becomes more
prevalent (as shown in Fig. 2b). As such, we conducted a within-subject
comparison of early- and late-list CRPs (see Fig. 4). The results of a
mixed multi-level model with timing (first 10 lists, last 10 lists), direc­
tion (forward, backward), lag (1–9), mind-wandering rate/state mindwandering, retrospective mind-wandering, and trait mind-wandering
for each participant predicting CRPs are shown in Table 2—we note
that as you increase the number of factors in an interaction, the model
becomes exponentially more complex the complexity of this analysis

1
We note that lag-CRPs are not statistically independent across lags, which
may violate the independence assumptions of both ANOVA and mixed-effects
models. For example, if a participant consistently makes transitions with a
lag of +1, their lag-CRP for +1 will be 1.0, and the lag-CRPs for all other lags
will necessarily be 0. This dependency between lag-CRPs can complicate sta­
tistical interpretations as higher values for one lag inherently reduce the values
for others. While this limitation does not invalidate the use of these models, it
serves as a caveat to the analyses and should be considered when interpreting
the results.
2
Given that lag-CRPs can be influenced by total recall, as a supplemental
analysis, we employed a permutation method to control for the influence of
overall recall differences on the shape of the lag-CRP (see Hong et al., 2023).
The resulting temporal bias curves reflected similar patterns as the lag-CRP
curves. This analysis is available as an online supplement on OSF.

makes it difficult to estimate reliably. However, the visual interpretation
of Fig. 4 suggests that the lag-recency effect decreases on later lists
(when mind-wandering tends to increase) for learners reporting higher
levels of mind-wandering rates (state mind-wanderers) and retrospec­
tive mind-wanderers, and trait mind-wanderers show an overall
impairment that appears stable throughout the task.
We also examined memory as a function of participants’ reported
experience. Specifically, recall on lists where participants did not report
mind-wandering (M = .45, SD = .15) was greater than recall on lists
where participants reported mind-wandering (M = .34, SD = .16), [t
(181) = 10.58, p < .001, d = .78]. We also analyzed CRPs as a function of
participants’ reported experience (see Fig. 5). The results of a mixed
multi-level model with whether participants reported mind-wandering,
direction (forward, backward), and lag (1–9) for each participant

predicting CRPs are shown in Table 3. Critically, there was a three-way
interaction between direction, lag, and whether participants were mindwandering such that participants were more likely to transition adja­
cently in the backward direction when they mind-wandering.
Finally, we also examined the probability of first recall (PFR) which
refers to the probability that items from a given serial position will be
recalled first. Again, the PFR captures how participants initiate recall
and in the present analysis, refers to the proportion of the time the word
from a given serial position was the first word recalled (see Fig. 6). A
repeated-measures ANOVA with 10 levels (serial position) and mindwandering rate/state mind-wandering, retrospective mind-wandering,
and trait mind-wandering as covariates (continuous variables)
revealed an effect of serial position [F(9, 1809) = 72.00, p < .001, η2p =
.26] such that the first word presented was most likely to be the first

word recalled. Additionally, serial position interacted with mindwandering rate/state mind-wandering [F(9, 1809) = 3.92, p < .001,
η2p = .02] and marginally interacted with retrospective mind-wandering
[F(9, 1809) = 1.85, p = .055, η2p = .01] such that individuals experi­
encing more state mind-wandering were less likely to initiate recall
according to serial position. However, serial position did not interact
with trait mind-wandering [F(9, 1809) = .40, p = .935, η2p < .01] such
that trait mind-wandering did not impact the recall initiation process.

Together, our findings suggest that being off task during encoding
detrimentally impacts memory, as expected. However, having a pre­
disposition to mind-wandering does not necessarily imply that the
learner has a lower memory ability per se. Rather, trait mind-wandering
reflects a higher likelihood of experiencing more frequent episodes of
state mind-wandering, which in turn reduces the chances of effective
encoding. This is supported by our results showing a correlation be­
tween trait and state mind-wandering. It is important to note that even
individuals who do not identify as trait mind-wanderers can still expe­
rience state mind-wandering episodes during a task, and it is these ep­
isodes that ultimately impair memory performance.
The lag-recency effect, or the tendency to recall items in sequence,
was particularly diminished among those considered trait mindwanderers. However, as seen in Fig. 4, the diminished lag-recency ef­
fect appears to be relatively stable throughout the task for trait mindwanderers while participants reporting more mind-wandering (state
mind-wanderers) or retroactively identifying as state mind-wanderers
seemed to demonstrate a decreased lag-recency effect later in the
memory task when average mind-wandering rates were increasing.
Thus, mind-wandering may alter the way items are encoded and

Discussion
The results of Experiment 1 provided valuable insights into how
mind-wandering impacts the dynamics of memory processes. Our
measures of mind-wandering (state, retrospective state, and trait) were
all positively correlated and as the task progressed, mind-wandering
increased and there was a corresponding decrease in recall. As ex­
pected, recall was adversely affected by the rate of mind-wandering
during the task/state mind-wandering, retrospective mind-wandering
ratings, and, to a lesser extent, trait mind-wandering (trait mindwandering was not a unique predictor of memory outcomes).

impacts both the encoding and retrieval process but a predisposition
towards mind-wandering does not impact how participants initiate the
retrieval process.
Experiment 2
In Experiment 1, it is possible that the mind-wandering probes
embedded in the list learning task impacted the encoding process (i.e.,
reactivity; see Double & Birney, 2019; Double et al., 2018; Murphy et al.,
2023 for an example of metacognitive reactivity). For example, it is
possible that the mind-wandering probes alert learners to their off-task
thoughts while studying, and this immediate feedback could prompt
them to refocus and intensify their efforts to stay “on task,” potentially
impacting encoding operations and subsequent memory performance.
As such, in Experiment 2, we removed the mind-wandering probes
during the study phase so that encoding was not disrupted. Thus, we
examined retrospective evaluations of mind-wandering and trait mindwandering without potentially biasing the encoding process. Similar
to Experiment 1, we expected participants with a higher propensity to
mind-wander, either as a retrospective judgment of their state (during
the specific task) or trait (in general) level, to exhibit poorer total recall,
a reduced lag-recency effect, and a lower likelihood of initiating
retrieval according to serial position.

subsequently retrieved, and trait mind-wanderers may be less able to
bind accompanying temporal-contextual cues of adjacent items in gen­
eral. However, we note that the occurrence of mind-wandering on a
given list did not significantly affect the lag-recency effect, and recall
was higher on lists where mind-wandering was not reported.
Finally, while the first presented word was most likely to be recalled
first regardless of mind-wandering status, learners who reported more
state mind-wandering and identified as retrospective mind-wanderers
showed a lesser tendency to initiate recall based on serial position. In
contrast, trait mind-wandering did not impact this recall initiation
pattern. This suggests that mind-wandering during a memory task

Materials and Procedure. The materials and procedure in Experi­
ment 2 were nearly identical to Experiment 1. However, in Experiment
2, we removed the mind-wandering probes during the study phase so
that encoding was not disrupted. Specifically, participants studied all 10
words on each list with no interruptions.
Reliabilities. To examine the reliability of the trait mind-wandering

questionnaire, we compared participants’ responses to each of the five
questions [Cronbach’s α = .81]. We also examined the reliability of
participants’ recall across the 30 lists [Cronbach’s α = .96].

are shown in Table 5. Although the four-way interactions did not reach
significance, visual inspection of Fig. 9 suggests that the lag-recency
effect may decrease on later lists for high retrospective mindwanderers, but trait mind-wanderers’ impairment appears to be
similar on early and later lists.
Finally, we examined the PFR via a repeated-measures ANOVA with
10 levels (serial position) with retrospective and trait mind-wandering
as covariates (continuous variables). Results revealed an effect of se­
rial position [F(9, 1809) = 41.21, p < .001, η2p = .17] such that the first
word presented was most likely to be the first word recalled. However,
serial position did not interact with retrospective mind-wandering [F(9,
1809) = .86, p = .560, η2p < .01] or trait mind-wandering [F(9, 1809) =
1.70, p = .083, η2p = .01] such that both retrospective judgments of state
mind-wandering and trait mind-wandering did not impact the recall
initiation process (see Fig. 10), contrasting Experiment 1 where retro­
spective state mind-wanderers showed a diminished PFR for the first
studied item.

We first examined the relationship between retrospective mindwandering ratings and trait mind-wandering (see Fig. 7). Pearson cor­
relations revealed that retrospective mind-wandering ratings were
related to trait mind-wandering [r = .61, p < .001]. Next, we investi­
gated the relationship between mind-wandering and recall performance
(see Fig. 7). Pearson correlations revealed that recall was negatively
related to retrospective mind-wandering ratings [r = -.33, p < .001] and
trait mind-wandering [r = -.20, p < .001]. A General Linear Model with
retrospective mind-wandering ratings and trait mind-wandering scores
predicting average memory performance (R2 = .11) revealed that
retrospective mind-wandering [β = -.34, t(201) = -4.02, p < .001]
uniquely predicted memory performance but trait mind-wandering did
not [β = -.00, t(201) = -.05, p = .959]. Similar to Experiment 1, we also
examined how recall changed as the task endured. A mixed multi-level
model with list-level recall accuracy modeled as a function of list
(continuous variable nested within individual participants) revealed
that recall decreased as the task endured [t(5915) = -9.44, p < .001].
CRPs split into quartiles based on retrospective mind-wandering
ratings and trait mind-wandering scores are shown in Fig. 8. The re­
sults of a mixed multi-level model with direction (forward, backward),
lag (1–9), retrospective mind-wandering, and trait mind-wandering for
each participant predicting CRPs are shown in Table 4. Here, neither
three-way interaction between lag, direction, and mind-wandering was
significant. Thus, in contrast to Experiment 1, the lag-recency effect was
not hindered in trait mind-wanderers (though we note that the patterns
were similar to Experiment 1).
To examine early- and late-list CRPs (see Fig. 9), we conducted a
mixed multi-level model with timing (first 10 lists, last 10 lists), direc­
tion (forward, backward), lag (1–9), retrospective mind-wandering, and
trait mind-wandering for each participant predicting CRPs. The results

Discussion
The outcomes of Experiment 2 further illustrated mind-wandering’s
nuanced impact on memory processes, drawing some parallels with and
also diverging from the findings of Experiment 1. As observed in
Experiment 1, recall performance declined throughout the task and was
inversely related to both retrospective mind-wandering ratings and trait
mind-wandering (and our measures of mind-wandering were again
related). Crucially, state mind-wandering emerged as a unique predictor
of memory performance while trait mind-wandering did not, indicating
that momentary lapses in attention have a more immediate effect on
memory than a general predisposition to mind wander.
Unlike in Experiment 1, trait mind-wanderers did not exhibit a
compromised lag-recency effect. However, trends again seemed to
indicate that the lag-recency effect weakened on later lists for in­
dividuals with higher rates of retrospective mind-wandering whereas
the patterns of trait mind-wanderers appeared relatively consistent
across early and later lists, though this was not statistically significant.
Finally, the tendency to recall the first-presented word as the first word
in the recall sequence was unaffected by the level of retrospective mindwandering or trait mind-wandering, also in contrast to Experiment 1.
Given that the only difference between Experiments 1 and 2 was the
presence of mind-wandering probes (a more sensitive measure of state
mind-wandering compared with retrospective mind-wandering ratings),
these probes might have influenced the encoding process. Thus, we
conducted a cross-experiment comparison to determine whether the
presence of though probes impacted the encoding and retrieval process.
Cross experiment comparison
To examine whether the presence of thought probes impacted overall
recall performance, we conducted an independent samples t-test. Results
revealed that recall in Experiment 1 with thought probes (M = .42, SD =
.16) was similar to recall in Experiment 2 without thought probes (M =
.44, SD = .16), [t(407) = 1.24, p = .215, d = .12]. In terms of CRPs, we
conducted a mixed multi-level model with experiment (Experiment 1 vs
Experiment 2), direction (forward, backward), and lag (1–9) for each
participant predicting CRPs. However, there were no interactions with
Experiment [all ps > .133], suggesting that the presence of probes did
not impact the lag-recency effect. In terms of the PFR, we conducted a 2
(Experiment 1 vs Experiment 2) × 10 (serial position) ANOVA. Results
revealed an effect of serial position [F(9, 3663) = 827.67, p < .001, η2p =
.67] such that the first word presented was most likely to be the first
word recalled but serial position did not interact with Experiment [F(9,
3663) = .78, p = .632, η2p < .01]. Thus, the presence of thought probes
does not seem to affect overall memory performance or the dynamics of
recall.
Next, given some of the disparate findings across experiments, we

Additionally, serial position interacted with retrospective mindwandering [F(9, 3654) = 3.08, p = .001, η2p = .01] such that in­
dividuals reporting experiencing more state mind-wandering were less
likely to initiate recall according to serial position. However, serial po­

combined the data from Experiments 1 and 2 to further examine the
effect of mind-wandering on lag-CRPs. Specifically, as an exploratory
analysis, we conducted a mixed multi-level model with direction (for­
ward, backward), lag (1–9), retrospective mind-wandering, and trait
mind-wandering for each participant predicting CRPs. Results revealed
that the three-way interaction between direction, lag, and trait mindwandering was significant [p < .001] but the three-way interaction
between direction, lag, and retrospective mind-wandering was not sig­
nificant [p = .660]. Thus, despite the differences between findings on
lag-CRP across Experiments 1 and 2, a model combining these data still
illustrates the effect.
Finally, we combined the data from Experiments 1 and 2 to further
examine the effect of mind-wandering on the PFR. A repeated-measures

influences episodic memory encoding and retrieval dynamics. Partici­
pants were presented with 30 lists of words to remember for recall tests,
and through our analysis, we sought to gain insights into how the state of
mind during encoding and the general propensity to mind wander
impact the learning process. We hypothesized that individuals with a
tendency towards mind-wandering would exhibit reduced efficiency in
leveraging temporal-contextual cues, resulting in compromised overall
recall performance (and potentially other retrieval dynamics as well,
such as the probability of first recall).
In terms of our measures of mind-wandering, trait mind-wandering
(as computed by the Mind-Wandering Questionnaire; Mrazek et al.,
2013) predicted state mind-wandering such that an individual with a
higher propensity to mind-wander was more likely to mind-wandering
during the memory task. Moreover, all measures of mind-wandering
were negatively related to memory performance such that mindwandering hurt memory performance and we also found that recall
was higher on lists for which participants did not report mindwandering compared to lists where they reported experiencing mindwandering. Additionally, we observed that mind-wandering increased
as the task endured, and consequently, recall decreased on later lists.
However, our analyses revealed that only state mind-wandering (not
trait mind-wandering) uniquely predicted recall performance. This
suggests that off-task thoughts during encoding can impact memory
processes, but trait mind-wandering is not necessarily accompanied by a
poor memory.
We also found some evidence that trait mind-wanderers were less
likely to use a given item’s accompanying temporal-contextual cues to
recall additional items, known as the lag-regency effect (see Kahana,
1996). Additionally, trends indicated that the lag-recency effect di­
minishes on later lists (a time when mind-wandering is likely to rise) for
participants who report elevated state mind-wandering rates and
retrospectively reported mind-wandering. However, individuals with a
trait predisposition to mind-wander generally displayed a consistent
impairment in this effect across the task (i.e., the lag-recency effect is
diminished for these individuals even on early lists).
Previous work has shown that the best learners are people who
allocate greater attentional intensity to the to-be-remembered infor­
mation and are also better able to prevent lapses of attention (Miller &

realization, exhibits both state and trait dimensions, such that some
individuals are more inclined to experience mind-wandering. In the
present study, we examined how mind-wandering, both as a momentary
occurrence and a consistent individual differences characteristic,

within a memory experiment may not reactively impact memorial pro­
cesses, consistent with some prior work showing no differences in
cognitive tasks as a function of the presence of thought probes (e.g.,
Arnicane et al., 2021; Wiemers & Redick, 2019).
Another potential reason for slight differences between Experiments
1 and 2 is that state measures, such as thought probes, offer a more
sensitive means of detecting actual mind-wandering during learning
tasks compared to retrospective judgments. State measures tend to
correlate more strongly with other state measures of the same construct
on a given occasion than with trait measures of the construct (and the
same applies to traits versus traits), indicating that both state and trait
tests demonstrate convergent and divergent validity (Zuckerman, 1983).
Thought probes, inserted at various points during the learning process,
prompt immediate reflection on the current focus of attention, capturing
mind-wandering episodes as they occur. This somewhat more real-time
assessment minimizes memory biases and the inaccuracies inherent in
post-task reflections where participants may forget, overlook, or
misjudge periods of inattention—retrospective judgments rely on the
individual’s ability to accurately recall and assess their attentional state
after the fact, a process susceptible to reconstruction errors and sub­
jective interpretations of what constitutes mind-wandering. Conse­
quently, thought probes provide a more direct and moment-to-moment
account of mind-wandering, making them a superior tool for under­
standing how attention fluctuates during learning. Thus, the removal of
these probes in Experiment 2 may have impacted our ability to recover
some of the effects of transient periods of task-irrelevant thought.
In sum, the present study has replicated and extended prior work
regarding the relationship between mind-wandering and episodic
memory, elucidating both the detrimental and nuanced aspects of how
different facets of individual differences in mind-wandering—state,
retrospective judgment, and trait—impact episodic memory encoding
and retrieval dynamics. This distinction underscores the complexity of
mind-wandering phenomena and their variable impacts on learning and
retrieval processes. By distinguishing how state and trait mind wan­
dering differentially impact encoding and retrieval processes, re­
searchers can better tailor interventions and strategies to mitigate the
negative effects of mind wandering. For instance, state mind-wandering
could be addressed by modifying task environments to enhance
engagement and reduce boredom or fatigue while trait mind-wandering
might require more comprehensive approaches such as training in
mindfulness or attention management techniques. As we advance our
understanding of these processes, this work not only contributes to the
theoretical knowledge in cognitive psychology but also suggests prac­
tical implications for enhancing educational strategies and interventions
aimed at improving memory performance in learning environments.

Unsworth, 2020, 2021; Unsworth & Miller, 2021). Theoretically, mindwandering disrupts the intensity of attention by diverting attention and
cognitive resources away from the task at hand, leading to inconsistent
attention and diminished attentional intensity, which adversely affects
cognitive engagement and regulation (e.g., Robison et al., 2022). As a
result, disruptions in the intensity of attention due to mind-wandering
may have weakened the lag-recency effect by impairing participants’
ability to consistently regulate attention and maintain intense focus
during encoding, thereby affecting the efficient temporal binding of
items and reducing the likelihood of recalling items in close succession
or at the beginning and end of lists. Together, prior work and the present
results suggest that mind-wandering leads to a binding deficit, whether
between items or between items and context, reflecting a potentially
task-general impairment. We propose that this deficit arises because
binding is inherently an attention-driven process, requiring both the
intensity and consistency of attention for optimal effectiveness.
Surprisingly, our analysis of how participants initiated the recall
process (i.e., probability of first recall, PFR; Howard & Kahana, 1999;
Kahana et al., 2002) indicated that state mind-wandering can affect how
individuals initiate recall, particularly reducing the tendency to start
recall with the initially presented word. This suggests that momentary
distractions or shifts in attention can disrupt the initial encoding of
items, subsequently altering the preferential retrieval of information
that was presented at the start of the list. However, increased trait mindwandering was not accompanied by a reduction in PFR for the first
studied item, highlighting that the effect of mind-wandering on retrieval
dynamics is likely driven by lapses of attention during encoding for a
given list, rather than the general propensity to mind-wander.
Mind-wandering’s impact on attentional intensity could have led to a
scattered or unfocused start to recall. This may result in a less strategic
retrieval approach, potentially affecting the tendency to initiate recall
with items from specific serial positions, such as the first or last items
presented, which are typically favored in undisturbed memory recall
processes (e.g., Kahana et al., 2002). Additionally, given the important
role of internally maintained context in driving the selection of items for
recall (see Polyn et al., 2009), mind-wandering could disrupt the initial
focus or ’spotlight’ on relevant contextual cues, leading to less efficient
recall initiation. This might result in a reduced likelihood of starting
recall sequences with items that were encoded in strong associative
contexts—either temporal or semantic—and also affect the recall of
subsequent items and overall recall performance.
We note that there were some important differences between Ex­
periments 1 and 2. In Experiment 1, where thought probes were used,
there was some evidence suggesting a compromised lag-recency effect
among individuals with high trait mind-wandering. This indicated po­
tential difficulties in leveraging temporal-contextual cues for memory
retrieval. Conversely, Experiment 2, which omitted thought probes, did
not show a significant hindrance in the lag-recency effect for trait mindwanderers but the pattern of the effect was in the same direction as in
Experiment 1 and the cross-experiment comparison still illustrated the
effect. Similarly, Experiment 2 showed that the word most likely to be
recalled first was not influenced by state or trait mind-wandering but
state mind-wandering impacted PFR in Experiment 1 as well as in the
cross-experiment analysis.
It is possible that the presence of thought probes in this list learning
task reactively impacted performance. Experiment 1, which employed
thought probes during the task, aimed to capture in-the-moment in­
stances of mind-wandering whereas Experiment 2 omitted these probes
to examine if their absence would influence encoding processes differ­
ently. However, a cross-experiment comparison revealed that overall
recall did not significantly differ between the two experiments, sug­
gesting that the immediate disruption caused by thought probes might
not have a substantial impact on overall memory outcomes. Addition­
ally, the presence of probes in Experiment 1 versus their absence in
Experiment 2 did not yield statistically significant differences in CRPs or
the PFR. Together, this suggests that the presence of thought probes
