mechanisms in a way that accommodates different units during
phonological encoding.
There is considerable evidence of cross-linguistic differences in terms
of what phonological unit gets selected immediately after lemma se­
lection. To unify models of phonological encoding and accommodate
cross-linguistic differences at this stage, O’Seaghdha (2015) refer to the
first selectable phonological units below the word as proximate units. In
Indo-European languages (e.g., English), studies of various paradigms
(e.g., speeded repeated production, form preparation, picture-word,

masked priming, speech errors, see Alderete and O’Séaghdha, 2022
for review) suggest that the proximate units are segments (i.e., indi­
vidual consonants and vowels). To simplify the nuanced discussion and
to be consistent with the study designs in the current work, we focus our
review on the production of monosyllabic words.
Segments as the proximate unit in Indo-European languages
Sevald and Dell (1994) examined how English speakers plan
phonological units in the production of monosyllabic consonant–vowelconsonant (CVC) words using a speeded repeated production task, in
which participants repeated four-word sequences as many times as
possible in eight seconds. The experiments manipulated the repetition
pattern of the onset C, V, and final C, such that each independently
followed an AAAA, ABBA, or ABAB pattern (i.e., three different levels of
repetition frequency, in descending order). The general logic of the
paradigm is that repetition benefits (faster speech) are expected when a
phonological unit is reused more frequently, reflecting easier processing
compared to alternating between different units. On the other hand,

repetition may also pose a cost due to spreading activation of similar but
nonidentical planning sequences, which results in selection difficulty
among these candidates (see the phonological competition model;
O’Seaghdha, et al., 1992; Peterson, 1991; Peterson et al., 1989). For
example, repeating the onset /p/ in PICK PUN PICK PUN may benefit
speech production; however, when producing PUN, the repeated /p/
cues /i/ because /i/ had just been produced after /p/ in PICK, leading to
a competition with the intended /u/. This inhibitory effect may
outweigh the benefits from the repetition of /p/, an effect sometimes
termed sequentially cued competition. Critically, because it is the repeti­
tion patterns of segments that determine these benefits and costs, and
this paradigm identifies functional units that are directly selected for
and assembled during phonological encoding, we infer that segments
serve as proximate units in English (see also O’Seaghdha & Marin,
2000).
Similarly, results from the form preparation task (also known as the
implicit priming paradigm) also provides evidence that segments are the
proximate units in Indo-European languages such as English and Dutch
(Meyer, 1990, 1991; Roelofs & Meyer, 1998). In this paradigm, partic­
ipants studied pairs of prompt-target words in blocks, with the target
words in a block being either homogeneous or heterogeneous with
respect to the proposed proximate unit. Borrowing examples from the
English experiment in O’Seaghdha et al. (2010), when the onset segment
was the proposed proximate unit, the target words in the homogeneous
block all shared the same onset (night-day; tint-dye; bread-dough; wetdew), whereas the target words in the heterogeneous block had different
onsets (night-day; snap-pea; grain-rye; pig-sow). Participants were asked
to memorize prompt-target pairs in study blocks. At test, participants
were presented with each prompt word and asked to produce the cor­
responding target. Participants’ reaction times for the target words were
faster when the onset segments were homogenous rather than hetero­
geneous, as speakers engaged in form preparation using onset segments.
This form preparation benefit implies that onset segments are the first
phonological units selected and buffered in production − - that segments
are the proximate units in English. Compared to the speeded repeated
production task, the form preparation task only measures reaction time
and does not require repeated production of phonological competitor
pairs, focuses more on planning and elicits less activation of competi­
tors, and thus generally obtains facilitatory priming from repeating
segments.

atonal syllable overlap between the prime and the first syllable of a
disyllabic target led to faster naming times (i.e., ba4 primes ba2 but not
bai2; bai4 primes bai2 but not ba2), even when orthography or tone did
not overlap (Chen et al., 2003). Chen et al. (2016) also showed syllabic
priming effects and suggested that sharing initial consonants elicits
interference, if anything, perhaps indicative of competition among
similar coactivated words or syllables. Once again, masked priming
suggests that proximate units are segments in English and atonal sylla­
bles in Mandarin.
The representation and processing of tone in Mandarin Chinese
In addition to the syllable versus segmental contrast, another key
difference between Mandarin and the languages that most production
theories have been developed for is that Mandarin is a tonal language, in
which tones are lexical and affect meanings. For example, in Mandarin,
the CV sequence ma can mean “mother”, “hemp”, “horse”, or “to scold”
depending on which of the four tones it is produced with. Despite the
prevalence of tone in African (Odden, 1995) and East Asian languages
(Yip, 1995), its representation in phonological encoding and the
cognitive mechanisms involved in selecting or integrating tone with
other phonological elements has not been well-established.
Earlier linguistic theories diverge on how tone is represented and
processed in speech production. Halle and Stevens (1971) posited that
tones are encoded as phonological features of vowels, whereas Leben
(1978) argued that tones are representationally independent of vowels
but realized as phonetic features of vowels (i.e., suprasegmental
features).
A sizable portion of the existing literature on tone representation has
relied on analyzing speech errors. One view is that tone functions
similarly as segments and is as susceptible to selection errors just as
consonants and vowels are (e.g., Alderete et al., 2019; Wan & Jaeger
1998; Moser, 1991; Shen, 1993). Some studies have reported various
movement errors of tone in context (i.e., perseverations, anticipations,
and exchanges), which are also commonly found with consonants and
vowels in English (Fromkin, 1971). For example, in Mandarin natural­
istic conversations, Wan and Jaeger (1998) found that lexical sub­
stitutions and blends have the same tones twice as often as expected by
chance. In tone errors, such as the perseveration error in which tui1 jian4
han2 (推荐函, meaning letter of support) was incorrectly produced as tui1
jian4 han4 (推荐汗, ungrammatical and meaning recommending some
sweat), tone slipped while the segmental content remained intact (i.e.,
Tone 4 from “jian” perseverated and substituted Tone 2 while “han”
remained as intended). This suggests that tone is sensitive to context like
segments are.
Another view is that tone is part of the metrical frame that segments
slot into right before articulation and is thus relatively immune to se­
lection errors (e.g., Chen, 1999; Kember et al., 2015; Roelofs, 2015). For
example, Chen (1999) reported that tone errors were rarer than segment
errors, and that the majority of tone errors were perseverations, whereas
segmental errors were primarily anticipations. That is, tones were found
to be both quantitatively and qualitatively different from segments,
which is incompatible with the idea of tone engaging in segment-like
early encoding. Chen proposed that tone is initially represented as
part of the phonological frame similar to lexical stress in English (i.e.,
tone is suprasegmental) and later translated into the phonetic configu­
ration of the vowel during phonetic encoding.
Investigations using controlled experimental methods shows that
these patterns of spontaneous speech error collection are not due to
perceptual biases (Chen, 1999; Alderete & Davies, 2019). One such
method is a tongue twister task that carefully manipulates the patterns
of segments and tones. Using a tongue twister paradigm, Kember et al.
(2015) designed 120 four-character Mandarin sequences that rotated
pairs of initial segments or tones, or both, across ABAB or ABBA format,
across positions (e.g., “突苦哭土” (tu1 ku3 ku1 tu3) comprises ABBA
initial segments and ABAB tones). Participants produced almost three

Syllables as the proximate unit in Mandarin Chinese
Also using the form preparation task, repeated onset segments did
not facilitate the production of Chinese words (e.g., Chen et al., 2002).
Instead, benefits only appeared when the whole syllable repeated, with
or without tone repetition (e.g., qing1-liang2; qing1-sheng1; qing1ting2; qing1-jiao1, or fei1-ji1; fei2-pang4; fei3-cui4; fei4-yan2), sug­
gesting that atonal syllables are proximate units in Mandarin Chinese. In
contrast, syllables are represented as abstract schemas in English (Sevald
et al, 1995). This cross-language difference in the role of segment versus
syllable might be due to a number of different linguistic characteristics
of these languages. For example, the structure of a Chinese syllable is
simpler (e.g., no consonant clusters like sk-, spl-), the number of Chinese
syllables is much smaller than in English, syllable boundaries are un­
ambiguous, and re-syllabification occurs only in English (e.g., read a
book is re-syllabified as rea-da-book). In particular, according to the
WEAVER++ model (Levelt et al., 1999), only after all the phonemes are
retrieved can speakers determine the arrangement of syllables in a word.
In Mandarin Chinese, the lack of re-syllabification may allow speakers to
retrieve the syllable as an integral unit at the beginning of phonological
encoding (also see discussion in Li, Wang & Idsardi, 2015).
Studies using a masked priming paradigm shows consistent results.
In word naming, the onset priming effect was robust in English (Forster
& Davis, 1991) but not in Mandarin (Verdonschot et al., 2013). Instead,
a syllabic priming effect was found in Mandarin masked priming, where
2

times as many segment errors as tone errors, which validates Chen’s
(1999) claim that segments are more prone to error than tones, even
with a task that supposedly affords both elements the same opportu­
nities for error due to competition between recently used components in
the same tongue twister sequence (e.g., k vs. t for segments and tone 1
vs. tone 3 for tones in the above example). (It is fair to note that part of
this disparity may be because Mandarin possesses a much larger in­
ventory of consonants and vowels than tones.).
Evidence from the form preparation paradigm which measures re­
action time rather than speech errors, described above, also indicates
that tone is a part of metrical frame in phonological encoding, as well as
that the smallest phonological unit that benefits Mandarin production
through repetition is the atonal syllables (rather than tone-bearing syl­
lables; Chen et al., 2002; O’Seaghdha et al., 2010). Critically, although
syllable + tone elicited larger form preparation effects than atonal syl­
lables, tone alone did not lead to form preparation effects (Chen et al.,
2002). Accordingly, Chen and Chen (2013) proposed a modified Levelttype production model that includes the proximate principle, suggesting
that atonal syllable representations are the first to be selected at the
stage of word form encoding in Chinese, and tone serves as a part of the
metrical frame, similar to stress in Indo-European languages. Tonal
syllables are formed later through unit-to-frame associations. This
modified Levelt-type production model is also supported by ERP evi­
dence in a Cantonese picture-word interference paradigm – interference
from tonal versus atonal syllables had similar effects in a stimuluslocked analysis, which is more sensitive to early-stage stimulus pro­
cessing; but the two conditions produced different effects in responselocked analysis, which is more sensitive to later processing closer to
overt naming (Wong et al., 2023). Using a primed picture naming task, a
recent ERP study on Mandarin word production also suggested that
tone-to-syllable integration happens in a later ERP time window (Chen
& Zhang, 2025).
Note that these differences between tonal and atonal languages do
not require that Chinese production arise from a fundamentally different
architecture. Indeed, Roelofs (2015) accounted for form preparation
effects in different languages using WEAVER++ simulations, including
English, Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese with three different proximate
units, supporting an inclusive model that accommodates cross-language
difference in phonological encoding. Though the WEAVER++ model
did not involve the concept of proximate unit, it proposed that phono­
logical contents (e.g., segments or syllables) and frames (e.g., tones) are
activated in a parallel fashion, followed by serial content-to-frame as­
sociation (Levelt et al., 1999). At the phonological encoding stage, the
cross-language difference was revealed in what phonological content
was retrieved and what served as the frames, similar to the proximate
unit principle and was incorporated in Roelofs’s (2015) Mandarin model
directly. The proximate principle also explained the role of other
phonological units. For example, in Chinese production, phonemic
segments are included as non-proximate units that are selected later
than the proximate unit — the atonal syllable. An attempt to prepare for
the segment in advance would violate the standard operating procedure
of phonological encoding in Chinese and may result in aborting the
procedure and restarting (this does not happen in English, which does
not have a phonological unit smaller than the proximate unit), some­
times leading to inhibitory effects when the onset repeats (Chen & Chen,
2013, Experiment 2) or when the rime repeats (Li, Wang, & Idsardi,
2015).

syllables when producing multiple monosyllables continuously, which
may improve the modified Levelt-type production model with the
proximate principle (Chen & Chen, 2013). Specifically, we adapted
Sevald and Dell’s (1994) paradigm of speeded repeated production of
monosyllabic words and asked Mandarin speakers to produce C + V +
tone sequences with different repetition patterns. Since Mandarin
proximate units and tone representations (or phonological encoding
during speech production) have not been studied using production
times, we first used a design that entertained all possibilities. Experi­
ment 1 was thus exploratory in nature, exploring possibilities that
included but were not limited to C, V, and tone functioning as inde­
pendent units in phonological encoding, CV functioning together as one
integrated syllabic unit, or tone functioning as a phonological feature of
V or CV syllable. Although not all possibilities are plausible (e.g., all
segments in a syllable function together as a whole unit seemed more
possible than each segment functions separately), we included all
combinations, given that the experimental design provides the oppor­
tunity to do so. Experiments 2 and 3 are confirmatory tests of results in
Experiment 1 that further examines how different phonological units are
encoded in speech production.
The first possibility is that tone is represented and processed with
segments. Due to pitch changes having a larger influence on how a
vowel is articulated relative to how a consonant is articulated (Lin et al.,
2013), it is more likely that (if it is represented with segments) tone
would be attached to vowels rather than to consonants. If tone is rep­
resented together with vowels, that means there are as many copies of
vowel representations as there are tones (e.g., /a/1, /a/2, /a/3, /a/4, /i/
1, /i/2, /i/3, /i/4, etc.). Assuming the pinyin-based analysis that there
are five monophthongs in Mandarin, that would mean there are 20
vowel representations in total. To fit this possibility in with the form
preparation evidence showing that atonal syllables can be initially
selected, it may be that the atonal syllable is selected as a whole unit at
first, then non-proximate units were processed, including the onset
(consonant) and vowel with tone.
The second possibility is that tone is represented together with the
whole syllable, so that there are as many copies of syllable representa­
tions as there are tones (e.g., /ba/1, /ba/2, /ba/3, /ba/4, /bi/1, /bi/2,
/bi/3, /bi/4). This possibility might be less likely given strong evidence
of form preparation benefits from repeated syllables alone regardless of
tone.
These two possibilities benefit from not needing an additional inte­
gration process, but they do not seem computationally efficient,
considering the increase in representational load. They assume that
speakers of tonal languages potentially have to hold many times more
representations in their syllabary or library of segments than strictly
necessary, based on the segmental inventory of the language. That leads
to the third possibility, that tone is represented independently of sylla­
bles and segments but needs to be integrated with them instead. This
possibility necessitates specifying the timing and mechanism through
which tone is combined with the rest of the phonological units, but it
achieves computational efficiency by avoiding duplicates of units with
similar or identical features (other than tone).
In the context of a speeded repeated production task, tone being
attached to vowels or syllables would predict that production would be
slower if more distinct tones are in a sequence, as a result of increased
competition between vowels or syllables with different tones. A specific
example is that if tone is attached to vowels, V + tone repeating in AAAA
should elicit a faster speech rate than other V + tone patterns regardless
of how the initial C repeats; if tone is attached to the entire CV syllable,
only the condition where the entire CV syllable with tone repeats should
yield benefits. In contrast, if tone is represented independently of syl­
lables or vowels, the repetition pattern or reuse of tone may not neces­
sarily have an impact on production times (i.e., tone repeating as AAAA
may elicit similar production speed compared to tone repeating in ABAB
or ABBA when the syllable sequence stays the same), if speakers have to
integrate a tone every time they produce a syllable, regardless of the

The present study
Given that speech error studies have revealed different patterns of
tone and segment errors, and that form preparation studies only measure
onset latency, the current work aims to investigate Mandarin phono­
logical processing using a production time measure. In particular, we
used a method that further lends insights into the representation and
online processing of tone, focusing on how tone is integrated with atonal

pattern of the sequences.

Experiment 1: Exploration of consonant, vowel, and tone
encoding
In Experiment 1, we adopted a full factorial design to explore how
Mandarin speakers encode phonological information in speech pro­
duction. Following Sevald and Dell (1994), we used monosyllabic words
and asked participants to produce C + V + tone sequences (resembling
the English C + V + C sequences in Sevald & Dell, 1994) of different
repetition frequency patterns.
Method
Participants
Fifty-eight undergraduates from the University of California San
Diego participated in the experiment in exchange for course credit.
Fourteen participants were excluded from our analyses because they
either did not produce more than 50 % usable data (exclusion criteria
explained below in Coding and Data Analysis), or had extensive prior
knowledge of tonal languages other than Mandarin (including
Cantonese). All 44 remaining participants indicated that they were
native Mandarin Chinese speakers with little to no exposure to other
tonal languages, and that they moved to the US after the age of 15.
Materials and design
We used a word sequence repetition task (adapted from Sevald &
Dell, 1994) to assess the effects of the repetition frequency of each po­
sition (consonant, vowel, or tone) and their interaction on speech rate.
Materials in this task were four-syllable sequences. All four-syllable se­
quences comprised semantically-unrelated monosyllabic words (i.e., all
sequences were nonwords) with no alternate pronunciation and were
easy to read, so that semantic processing and orthographic difficulty
would not affect performance. Additionally, we avoided Tone 3 (due to
tone sandhi) and polyphones. The study used a within-subjects, 3 (C
Pattern) x 3 (V Pattern) x 3 (Tone Pattern) factorial design, such that
each of the three Positions of each monosyllabic word (C, V, and tone;
generated from three different phoneme sets) repeated independently in
one of three repetition patterns (AAAA, ABBA, or ABAB). This created 27
possible combinations for each phoneme set. The experiment used three
phoneme sets, so that there were 81 trials in the experiment. Each
phoneme set consisted of two sounds in each position, and three coun­
terbalancing lists were constructed to randomize which sound in each
position was arbitrarily assigned as Sound A or Sound B in each repe­
tition pattern across participants. Table 1 shows the pinyin of the sounds
in the three phoneme sets. Taking Phoneme Set 1 as an example, if the C
repeated in a AAAA pattern (b__b__b__b__), V in a ABBA pattern
(_a__i__i__a_), and tone in a ABAB pattern (__2__1__2__1), the resulting fourword sequence would be “拔逼鼻巴” (ba2 bi1 bi2 ba1). Table 2 includes
27 example trials from one Phoneme Set.

experimental task (modeled closely after Sevald & Dell, 1994) and went
through five practice trials with each participant. The beginning of each
trial was signaled by a fixation cross (presented for 200 ms) and a highpitched tone. Then, participants saw a four-syllable sequence written in
Simplified Chinese characters centered on the screen, with the word “准
备” (prepare) printed underneath for eight seconds. They were instruc­
ted to silently rehearse the sequence during that period in preparation
for the upcoming production phase. At the end of the eight seconds,
participants heard three low-pitched tones and one high-pitched tone as
a countdown signal for the production phase. The high-pitched tone and
the disappearance of the word “准备” (prepare) signaled the beginning
of the eight second long production phase, during which participants
were instructed to produce the four-word sequence aloud repeatedly as
quickly and as accurately as possible. At the end of the production phase,
a high-pitched tone signaled the end of the trial. Participants pressed the

Procedure
Participants first completed a language history questionnaire, in
which they indicated whether they identified as native speakers of
Mandarin Chinese, whether they spoke any other tonal languages, and
the age at which they moved to the US.
Then, an experimenter explained the instructions of the

spacebar to advance to the next trial whenever they were ready. (Note
that the removal of the visual stimulus ensures that initial orthographic
processing is completed before articulation begins, so that the produc­
tion stage more purely reflects phonological rather than orthographic
encoding.) The experimenter provided feedback to the participants for
five practice trials before the participants completed the 81 experi­
mental trials independently.

Coding and data analysis
The spoken responses for each trial were audio-recorded and later
coded into the dependent variable (speech rate) with the aid of Au­
dacity, an audio processing program. Specifically, we manually counted
the number of syllables produced within the eight second production
period, excluding any production that overlapped with the beginning or
terminal beep signal of each trial. Based on our goal to indirectly infer
the proximate units of speech using speech rate when a sequence was
correctly produced, we excluded 523 (14.67 %) trials which included
speech errors, significant disfluencies (other than breathing, such as the
inclusion of fillers or any other non-speech sounds or restarting a
sequence), abnormal reaction times (below 150 ms or above 800 ms in
response to the beginning signal) or other technical errors, resulting in
3,041 (85.33 %) analyzable trials. Two counters (native Mandarin
speakers) were each responsible for counting half of the trials and crosschecking the other half that the other counter initially counted. Of the
analyzable trials, only 29 trials led to inter-counter disagreements,
which were all resolved with a third round of counting. The syllable
counts were then transformed into average production times per syllable
by dividing 8,000 ms by the syllable count.
The statistical analyses were conducted using R (R Core Team, 2014)
and the lme4 package (Bates et al., 2014). In our main analysis,
following Sevald and Dell (1994), we focused on average production
times and used a linear mixed-effects model to analyze the effects of C
pattern, V pattern, tone pattern, and their interactions. We attempted to
use the maximal random effects structure for the models, and the models
that converged included random intercepts for participants and items (i.
e., lmer (AvgTime ~ O * V * Tone +(1|participant)+(1|item)). Each
item refers to each four-syllable sequence.

fewer errors in each condition than previous work using the same
paradigm that focuses on error type analysis, we did not have enough
power to conduct systematic comparisons between error types that may
reveal time course of tone vs. segment encoding.
Our results thus far have shown that speech rates in Mandarin pro­
duction cannot be reliably predicted by repetition of each of the
phonological elements alone. In addition, we obtained significant in­
teractions between C and tone, χ2(4) = 23.64, p < .001; V and tone,
χ2(4) = 27.12, p < .001; as well as a three-way interaction between C, V,
and tone, χ2(8) = 23.04, p = .003. As described above, the repetition
patterns in these three positions trended in different directions,
rendering these interactions difficult to interpret in terms of repetition
frequency alone. Moreover, these interactions suggest that perhaps the
three phonological elements should not be treated as completely inde­
pendent of each other. Thus, we conducted additional post-hoc analyses
to explore whether the current data set could help to inform how
phonological units are encoded in Mandarin production, by analyzing
what groupings of C, V, and tone could better predict speech rate.1

Results
Our planned analysis revealed significant main effects of repetition
pattern for all three positions: C, V, and tone. However, unlike English,
more frequent repetition did not necessarily lead to faster speech rate.
Table 3 shows the by-subject mean production times for all 27 condi­
tions, and Table 4 shows the marginal means for C,V, and tone repetition
patterns. Most strikingly, when C, V, and tone patterns were all AAAA,
the speech rate was not the fastest (M = 278 ms; e.g., when both V and
tone patterns were ABBA and the C pattern was AAAA, M = 269 ms). As
can be seen, speech rate was the fastest when the C pattern was ABBA
(280 ms), followed by ABAB (285 ms). Surprisingly, AAAA was the
slowest (290 ms). The main effect of the C repetition pattern was sta­
tistically significant, χ2(2) = 12.08, p = .002. Similarly for the V pattern,
ABBA was the fastest (279 ms), followed by ABAB (283 ms), and finally
AAAA (292 ms); the main effect of V repetition pattern was statistically
significant, χ2(2) = 21.07, p < .001. Meanwhile, the tone repetition
pattern followed a different trend, with AAAA being the fastest (280 ms),
then ABAB (286 ms), and ABBA (290 ms); the main effect of tone
repetition pattern was statistically significant, χ2(2) = 12.57, p = .002.
The proportion of invalid trials of each condition are shown in Ta­
bles 3 and 4. Although there is some trade-off between speed and ac­
curacy/disfluency (e.g., the C pattern), the overall pattern of results
cannot be explained as a speed-accuracy trade-off (e.g., when both C and
tone patterns were AAAA and the V pattern was ABAB, speed and ac­
curacy were similar to AAAA). Given that our dataset contained far

Post-hoc analyses
In light of the surprising findings from our planned analysis,
particularly that the repetition frequency of the phonological elements
(when they were treated as independent units) did not reliably predict
speech rate, we explored the potential dependence between C, V, and

tone in three post-hoc analyses.
First, we explored the possibility of a speech rate advantage when
there are covarying repetition patterns. That is, perhaps Mandarin
speech production is more affected by whether different phonological
units share the same repetition pattern or not, more so than what the
exact pattern is. At this point, we have not yet established how exactly
phonological units are encoded in Mandarin speech production, other
than suggesting that (given the results of the planned analyses) it is
highly unlikely that C, V, and tone function as independent units. Thus,
in order to explore if and how Mandarin phonological elements may be
dependent on each other, we recoded our data by analyzing two of the
elements at a time (i.e., C and V, V and tone, and C and tone) and
comparing production times in trials where those two elements either
shared the same repetition pattern or not. The results showed that
whether C and V shared the same pattern made no difference to speech
rate (285.51 ms when C and V shared the same pattern and 285.17 ms
they did not; 0.35 ms difference, z = -0.09, p = .93), whereas signifi­
cantly faster speech rates were observed when C and tone shared the
same pattern (277.73 ms for same and 289.06 for different; 11.33 ms
difference, z = 3.05, p = .002), and when V and tone shared the same
pattern (276.93 ms for same and 289.46 ms for different; 12.54 ms
difference, z = 3.25, p = .001). Because C and V seemed to behave
similarly in relation to tone, we additionally explored the notion that CV
may together function as a syllabic unit. We once again recoded the data
and compared trials in which tone shared the same repetition pattern
with the syllables (i.e., CV treated as one combined unit) with other
trials. We found that speech rates were also faster when CV shared the
same pattern with tone (274.30 ms for same and 286.66 ms for different;
12.36 ms difference, z = 2.15, p = .03).
The set of comparisons above points towards two points: One, tone
seemed to have a privileged status in speech production, which was
easier when tone was “attached” to another element (i.e., shared the
same repetition pattern with another element). Two, given that the
speech advantages we observed above were around the same magnitude
regardless of whether tone was attached to C or V alone or CV as a unit,
we suspected that C and V may not be represented independently in
Mandarin, unlike in English. However, these results remained pre­
liminary, as they were inferences that were not obtained from direct
comparisons. Our second post-hoc analysis attempted to address this
limitation by using a single model. Specifically, we re-classified the trials
into five categories: trials in which only one tone was involved (tone
pattern was AAAA), trials in which there were two tones (i.e., tone
pattern was either ABBA or ABAB) that covaried with (i.e., shared the
same repetition pattern with) C alone, V alone, both C and V, and neither
C nor V.
We compared the production times across the five covariation cat­
egories, in order to assess whether trials involving two tones were slower
than those involving only one, and whether covariation between tone
and other elements produced any speech rate advantage. The results are
shown in Fig. 1. Our model revealed that there was a statistically sig­
nificant difference in speech rate among these five categories (χ2(4) =
41.80, p < .001). Specifically, the effect was solely driven by the slow
production times in the “neither” condition. Pairwise comparisons
showed that there was no difference between trials that only contained
one tone (279 ms; 1023 trials) and trials that contained two tones
sharing the same repetition pattern as C alone (279 ms; 439 trials), V
alone (279 ms; 448 trials), or both C and V (272 ms; 226 trials); pairwise
comparisons ps > .05. Importantly, the trials involving two tones that
did not share repetition pattern with any other element (302 ms; 905
trials) were significantly slower than all other conditions: 22.39 ms
slower than one tone (z = -5.22, p < .001), 22.24 ms slower than sharing
with C alone (z = -4.98, p < .001), 23.06 ms slower than sharing with V
alone (z = -4.95, p < .001), and 29.7 ms slower than sharing with both C
and V (z = -4.89, p < .001).
These comparisons confirmed that speech production was signifi­
cantly more difficult when tone did not covary with other elements.

ba2 ba2), two tones that covaried with both C and V (e.g., ba2 di1 di1 ba2), C
Alone (e.g., ba2 da1 da1 ba2), V Alone (e.g., ba2 bi1 bi1 ba2), and Neither (e.g.,
ba1 bi2 bi1 ba2)Note. Error bars represent standard errors.

Additionally, based on the lack of additive speech rate advantage when
tone shared the repetition with both C and V, compared to with C or V
alone, C and V may form a single proximate unit together in Mandarin.
Notably, trials involving one tone were not significantly different from
trials involving two tones, with the exception of the “neither” condition,
suggesting that it may not be the number of unique phonological units
but rather the CV-tone pairing that affects Mandarin production. In
particular, we speculated that perhaps trials the “neither” condition (e.
g., ba2 bi1 ba1 bi2: AAAA for C, ABAB for V, and ABBA for tone) was
particularly difficult because it is only in this condition that each CV was
paired with two different tones in the sequence (e.g., ABAB for CV and
ABBA for tone), such that speakers had to repeatedly “detach” a tone
from a CV syllable reattach another tone in preparation for the next time
it appears in the sequence, slowing production (ba was paired with tone
2 and then tone 1 within the same production sequence). In all other
conditions, each CV syllable is only paired with one tone (see Fig. 1). We
refer to this speculation as the reattachment hypothesis and explored the
validity of it in the third post-hoc analysis.
In the third and final post-hoc analysis, we redefined repetition using
CV syllable as a unit. Notably, in addition to the previous patterns
(AAAA, ABBA, and ABAB), this way of coding now presents a new
possibility of the ABCD pattern (e.g., ba_di_da_bi_; previously coded as
ABBA for C and ABAB for V; see Table 2). More importantly, we also
classified trials into conditions where “reattaching” is required versus
not. Reattaching is defined by whether each unique CV syllable is only
paired with one (i.e., no reattaching) versus two tones in the sequence
(and thus requiring detaching from one tone and reattaching to another
repeatedly).
We assessed the effects of CV repetition pattern, reattaching, and
their interaction on production times. Fig. 2 shows the results. Consis­
tent with what we have reported thus far, CV repetition pattern did not
affect speech rate (χ2(3) = 6.15, p = .10) and there was thus no inter­
action with reattaching (χ2(2) = 1.83, p = .40). Critically, we observed a
main effect of reattaching (χ2(1) = 16.37, p < .001), such that speech
rate was on average 23 ms slower when each CV syllable was required to
reattach to a different tone within the sequence (301 ms), compared to
when no reattaching was required (278 ms).
Discussion
The planned analyses in Experiment 1 showed that the repetition
patterns in C, V, and tone trended in different directions, rendering in­
teractions between these phonological elements. Most strikingly, pro­
duction was not the fastest when all elements repeat in the AAAA

in the experiment in exchange for course credit. Eighteen were excluded
from our analyses because they either did not produce more than 50 %
usable data (based on the same exclusion criteria in Experiment 1, noted
above in Coding and Data Analysis), had extensive prior knowledge of
tonal languages other than Mandarin, including Cantonese, or had un­
stable internet connections. All 26 remaining participants indicated that
they were native Mandarin Chinese speakers with little to no exposure to
other tonal languages, and that they moved to the US after the age of 15.
Materials and design
The primary goal of Experiment 2 was to test the reattachment hy­
pothesis with a simpler design. That is, we investigated whether speech
rate was indeed slower when each CV was paired with more than one
tone in a sequence (i.e., requiring reattaching). We used the same word
sequence repetition task as Experiment 1, with the logic that slower
speech rate indicates greater encoding difficulty. We adopted a withinsubjects, 2 (CV Number) x 2 (Tone Number) x 2 (Repetition Pattern)
factorial design, such that the four-syllable sequences comprised either
one or two CV units; either one or two tones; and when two CV units or
two tones were involved, they either followed an ABBA or ABAB pattern.
Out of the eight conditions, the two conditions that paired one CV with
two tones were further coded as “requiring reattaching”, while the other
six were recoded as “no reattaching required”. The materials were
constructed using the nine phoneme sets in Table 5, counterbalancing
across participants which sound was assigned as Sound A or Sound B in
each repetition pattern. In sum, each participant contributed to 72 trials
(i.e., 8 conditions x 9 Phoneme Sets). Table 6 shows the eight experi­
mental conditions from Phoneme Set 1. Taking this set as an example,
“拔巴巴拔” (ba2 ba1 ba1 ba2) and “笛低笛低” (di2 di1 di2 di1) were the
two conditions that required each CV to detach from a tone and reattach
to another within the sequence, with the former reattaching less
frequently than the latter (i.e., reattaching every other word versus
every word).

pattern. These results suggest that the three phonological elements
should not be treated as completely independent of each other. Sup­
portively, the post-hoc analyses suggested that participants seemed to
benefit from the conditions in which tone covaried with other phono­
logical elements. C and V may function together as a single phonological
unit in production, whose production difficulty relies on the pairing with
tone. This hypothesis was supported by two key findings from post-hoc
analyses: First, the covarying advantage was not additive. Tone co­
varying with one segment or with the whole atonal syllable yielded the
same benefits. Because changing one segment also changes the whole
atonal syllable (e.g., ba vs. da are two different syllables, just as ba vs.
di), this lack of additivity suggests that the critical point is whether the
whole CV syllable changes. Second, regardless of the CV repetition
pattern, production was slowed when a particular CV was paired with
more than one tone in a sequence. In addition, the CV repetition pattern
itself did not predict production speed. Therefore, we developed the
Reattachment Hypothesis, which speculates that Mandarin speakers
represent CVs (or atonal syllables) as “chunks,” programming each with
tone upon phonetic encoding, so that producing the same chunk with
more than one tone in a sequence is difficult. We simplified the design of
Experiment 1 to directly test the reattachment hypothesis in Experiment
2.

Procedure
The procedure was exactly the same as Experiment 1, except that the
experiment was administered remotely over the internet, via Zoom.
Instead of having the participants control the pace of the experiment in
between trials, we constructed a video such that each trial was presented
one after another without breaks. An experimenter showed the video to
each participant using the screen share function, and the participant’s
spoken responses were recorded. The preparation and the production
durations remained unchanged from Experiment 1 (i.e., eight seconds
each).

Experiment 2: Investigation of the reattachment hypothesis
In Experiment 2, we simplified the design by treating C and V as a
single phonological unit, so that C and V always repeated in the same
pattern. Adopting a full factorial design with this change (thus fewer
combination possibilities or conditions), we first repeated the planned
analyses in Experiment 1 to examine whether the repetition pattern of
CV and/or tone might predict production speed, and tested the reat­
tachment hypothesis to see whether participants would benefit from
tone covarying with CV.

Coding and data analysis
Similar to Experiment 1, we manually counted the number of sylla­
bles produced within the eight second production period, excluding any
production that overlapped with the beginning or terminal beep signal
of each trial. Based on our goal to indirectly infer the proximate units of
speech using speech rate when a sequence was correctly produced, we
excluded 331 (17.68 %) trials using the same exclusion criteria as

The power analysis was conducted through simulation based on the first
experiment’s data, with the SimR package in Rstudio and using Monte Carlo
simulations on a range of sample sizes (Green & MacLeod, 2016). Each simu­
lation was run with a linear mixed effect model structure on the reattachment
main effect, and results of all analyses showed that 26 participants would be
enough to reach the 80% power threshold.

Experiment 1, resulting in 1541 (82.32 %) analyzable trials. Two
counters (native Mandarin speakers) were each responsible for counting
half of the trials and cross-checking the other half that the other counter
initially counted. Of the analyzable trials, only 25 trials led to intercounter disagreements, which were all resolved with a third round of
counting. The syllable counts were then transformed into average pro­
duction times per syllable by dividing 8,000 ms by the syllable count.
There were two major analyses in this experiment. First, we used a
linear mixed-effects model to analyze the effects of the number of CV,
Tone, Repetition Pattern, and their interactions on average production
times. We used the maximal random effects structure, such that the
resulting model included all the fixed effects as by-subject random
slopes and the counterbalancing lists as the by-item random slope. This
analysis allowed us to (as in Experiment 1) investigate whether the
number of different phonological units involved and their repetition
frequency affected speech rate. Second, we used another linear mixedeffects model to analyze the effects of reattaching and its interaction
with the repetition pattern on speech rate. Again, we used the maximal
random effects structure, which included reattaching, repetition
pattern, and their interaction as by-subjects random slopes and the
counterbalancing lists as the by-item random slope.
