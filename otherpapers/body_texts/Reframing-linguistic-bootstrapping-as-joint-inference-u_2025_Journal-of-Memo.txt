Introduction
With the advent of large language models (LLMs) it has become hard
to deny that, if you have little to no limitations on the quantity of input
data, amount of computation, or memory size, much linguistic structure
can be learnt (Mahowald et al., 2024; Piantadosi, 2023). Clearly human
learners are not as unconstrained and therefore LLMs cannot be said to
mimic human language learning. However, in light of the fact that these
models can learn what they do without the need for language-specific
learning mechanisms or innate linguistic knowledge, it is important to
reassess existing debates on language acquisition in children.
Language models have been proposed as useful tools for building
proof-of-concept arguments for what is learnable from linguistic input
(Lappin, 2021, ch. 1.2, Pearl, 2023; Portelance & Jasbi, 2024; Tsuji,
Cristia, & Dupoux, 2021; Warstadt & Bowman, 2023). As such, they can
inform innateness debates (Clark & Lappin, 2011; Crain & Thornton,
2012), which try to establish how much innate knowledge is necessary
to learn language and how specific to language learning strategies

must be for its acquisition. Proofs of concept are however limited
to informing us of what can possibly be learnt under the learning
conditions of the target model. Portelance and Jasbi (2024) suggest that
a more interesting way to use these language models is for hypothesis
generation, whereby models are used to study the dynamics at play
during language learning to propose novel theories about the strategies
which drive language acquisition in people. This paper adopts this
approach, proposing a unified explanation for linguistic bootstrapping
phenomena.
Linguistic bootstrapping theories posit that children use their prior
knowledge in one linguistic domain, for example syntactic relations,
to help with the acquisition of another, such as the meanings of new
words. Here, we will address two theories, semantic bootstrapping
and syntactic bootstrapping. These proposals come from a theoretical
landscape which assumed that learning is algorithmic or stage-based
in nature, requiring some prior innate linguistic knowledge as a starting point. The bootstrapping debates have centered on the questions
what linguistic knowledge do we start from? and how do children use

initially posits that learners must start with ‘‘sophisticated presuppositions about the structure of language’’. In other words, children start
with some syntactic knowledge to bias their acquisition of new word
meanings. Discussion of syntactic bootstrapping have for the most part
been limited to the acquisition of verb meanings, though in principle
it may extend to other types of ‘hard’ words (Fisher, Gertner, Scott,
& Yuan, 2010; Gleitman, Cassidy, Nappa, Papafragou, & Trueswell,
2005). There is once again indirect empirical evidence which supports
this hypothesis, such as children’s ability to infer a novel verb’s meaning based on its argument structure (Naigles, 1990). For example, if
a child is exposed to the transitive condition in Fig. 1 and they have
learnt to identify such argument structures, they can infer the presence
of an agent (someone performing an action) and a patient (someone
upon whom an action is performed) are likely necessary in the correct
visual interpretation, picking the two-participant event—and more generally identifying and learning the meaning of ‘gorping’. In its original
strong form, syntactic bootstrapping requires innate language-specific
abstract knowledge of syntactic structures, which is independent of
word meaning or grounding. More recent descriptions however present
early abstract structural knowledge as possibly probabilistic and learnt
from more primitive concepts (Fisher, Jin, & Scott, 2020; Gleitman
et al., 2005).
Though sometimes erroneously characterized as opposing theories in the mythology of the field, semantic and syntactic bootstrapping are complementary theories.5 Their characterization as conflicting
may stem from the conjecture that semantic bootstrapping leads to a
lexically-driven view of language acquisition where language is learnt
by mapping words to meanings and syntactic primitives (bottom-up
perspective), while syntactic bootstrapping leads to a more abstractionbased view where language is learnt by mapping sentential structures
to word meanings (top-down perspective). However, these theories can
very much coexist. In Pinker (2009)’s semantic bootstrapping proposal,
the second stage of learning after primitive syntactic categories are
learnt is called ‘‘structure-dependent distributional learning’’ and resembles syntactic bootstrapping. In Gleitman et al. (2005), syntactic
bootstrapping is also characterized as a multi-stage process where,
initially children learn words – mostly concrete nouns – by mappings
them to salient referents in their extra-linguistic context. Once enough
of these words are known they can infer syntactic knowledge such
as clausal structure to bootstrap the acquisition of harder words —
such as verbs or adjectives. In either case, one theory does not exclude
the other; semantic and syntactic bootstrapping coexistence is possible,
they are simply studied as independent learning strategies, where in
principle the other strategy could also be at work. In their review
article on syntactic bootstrapping, Fisher et al. (2020) articulate the
current leading view: that these are independent learning strategies
which both rely on the same tight bond between syntactic and semantic
representation.

this knowledge to bootstrap new knowledge and eventually acquire language? (Gleitman, 1990; Grimshaw, 1981; Landau & Gleitman, 1985;
Pinker, 1984).
Linguistic bootstrapping debates
Though linguistic bootstrapping can extend to all levels of linguistic
representation, from phonology to pragmatics, we will concentrate on
the two types which have been most discussed, semantic bootstrapping
and syntactic bootstrapping.
Broadly, in semantic bootstrapping proposals, children are said to
use their knowledge of semantics and meaning to bootstrap syntactic
knowledge. The most famous formulation comes from Pinker (1984,
2009). In this version, semantic bootstrapping is envisioned as an early
language learning strategy which allows children to learn syntactic
primitives such as syntactic categories (noun, verb, adjective...), by
mapping them to early perceptual or cognitive categories4 (individual,
action, state...). For example, children may induce a syntactic category
like noun by noticing that there are words which name the semantic
perceptual categories of persons or things. Once categories are learnt,
a more symbiotic exchange would then emerge between syntactic and
semantic knowledge to acquire new structures and word meanings.
There is indirect empirical evidence which supports this hypothesis,
such as the observation that children’s first nouns correspond to physical objects, first verbs to actions, and first adjectives to perceptually
salient attributes. Pinker describes semantic bootstrapping as a form
of distributional learning, stating that ‘‘children always give priority
to distributionally based analyses, and [semantic bootstrapping] is
intended to explain how the child knows which distributional contexts
are the relevant ones to examine’’ (Pinker, 2009, p. 42–43). In this
view, language learning can be thought of as a probabilistic mapping
problem. Semantic bootstrapping is then a theory that tries to explain
how children use aspects of meaning to acquire core pieces of syntactic
structure.
Syntactic bootstrapping proposals instead describe processes which
involve the use of syntactic knowledge to bootstrap new meanings and
semantic knowledge. The proposal and first full description of this
theory is associated with Gleitman (1990). Gleitman makes the case
that the same problems which plague syntax acquisition and have motivated many syntactic theories, also exist for vocabulary acquisition:
the hypothesis space over syntactic structure and word meanings is
simply too vast and must be limited in some way by prior knowledge or
learning strategies to account for children’s language learning abilities.
As a way to limit this hypothesis space for vocabulary acquisition, she

Somewhat confusingly, it is called semantic bootstrapping, even though in
its original formulation, it never refers to any knowledge of formal semantics
or linguistic meaning, but instead to perceptual concepts independent of
language.

allowing induced syntactic knowledge to affect the acquisition of semantic representations. Like Abend et al. (2017), our model addresses
both semantic and syntactic acquisition; however being a neural network, we are able to introduce the additional complication of learning
not just grammar, but semantic representations for words and sentences
from scratch as well. It thus more closely models young children’s
reality. We will use this model to make a different proposal about
the relation between syntactic and semantic bootstrapping from Abend
et al. (2017), who argued that syntactic bootstrapping is a downstream
effect of semantic bootstrapping as the main learning strategy. We
propose that syntactic and semantic bootstrapping are both downstream effects of a more general joint learning strategy. While still
honoring the leading view that syntactic and semantic bootstrapping
are complementary acquisition strategies (Fisher et al., 2020), we differ
from these proposals in that we do not study them as independent
learning processes, but instead offer a unified account relying on their
interdependence.

Grammar induction models and linguistic bootstrapping
Grammar induction is the task of learning a grammar – or set
of rules and structures – given a corpus of sentences. In the past,
it had proven quite difficult to do using purely statistical learning
or distributed models, especially for natural language which requires
more expressive grammars, such as probabilistic context-free grammars
(PCFG; Cohn, Blunsom, & Goldwater, 2010; Klein & Manning, 2004,
2005; Perfors, Tenenbaum, & Regier, 2011). At the time, the solution
had been to use probabilistic models with more informed prior knowledge of language, such as access to categories, head-branching bias or
semantic mappings (Chater & Manning, 2006; Muralidaran, Spasić, &
Knight, 2020). One such model of particular interest to this paper was
the semantic bootstrapping model from Abend, Kwiatkowski, Smith,
Goldwater, and Steedman (2017), which was an instantiation of the
theory by the same name. The authors proposed a Bayesian grammar
induction model which learnt both syntactic derivations for sentences
and word meanings conditioned on knowing sentential meanings (given
in the form of compositional semantic derivations). Using their model,
the authors argued that syntactic bootstrapping is an emergent effect
which follows from this tight bond imposed on syntax and semantics
during semantic bootstrapping. In such a proposal, syntactic bootstrapping is not a learning strategy in its own right, but an effect which
follows from semantic bootstrapping strategies.
More recently, access to better computational resources and neural
network architectures have lead to significant advances for grammar
induction models – as with language models. Researchers have managed to design successful distributional approaches to natural language grammar induction without the need for overly informative
priors (Drozdov, Verga, Yadav, Iyyer, & McCallum, 2019; Kim, Dyer, &
Rush, 2019). These models have since been augmented by introducing
visual-grounding, finding that access to visual information helps models
induce grammars producing more accurate constituency trees (Jin &
Schuler, 2020; Shi, Mao, Gimpel, & Livescu, 2019; Wan, Han, Zheng,
& Tuytelaars, 2022; Zhao & Titov, 2020) — a result reminiscent of
semantic bootstrapping.
Neural grammar induction models are different from neural language models in that they explicitly enforce the learning of a grammar
that follows a set of formal constraints, for example that the grammar be a PCFG. This approach to grammar and language learning is
different from neural language models such as LLMs or even smaller
language models trained on child directed utterances (Huebner, Sulem,
Cynthia, & Roth, 2021) which generally make fewer assumptions about
the structure of language and in turn do not explicitly learn a grammar,
but may implicitly do so. Given their implicit nature, the most we can
do with LLMs is to study their external linguistic productions with
carefully designed probes to see what grammatical knowledge they
may have acquired (Hu, Gauthier, Qian, Wilcox, & Levy, 2020; Linzen,
Dupoux, & Goldberg, 2016; Warstadt et al., 2020) – in other words
they are observationally adequate models of language learning. Neural
grammar induction models on the other hand have explicit representations of grammar which can be directly studied, affording them a
greater degree of descriptive adequacy (Portelance & Jasbi, 2025).
Bootstrapping theories are about the internal learning procedures that
lead to specific types of grammatical and semantic knowledge, for
example syntactic categories or semantic roles. With this paper, we
want to go beyond extrinsic evidence and seek intrinsic evidence.
Taking inspiration from recent advances in neural grammar induction, we present our own model, building on previous work, which
additionally learns to interpret visual information via access to induced
trees. Previous work on visually-grounded grammar induction used
fixed pretrained image embeddings as their representations for visual
semantic context, while we train our visual embeddings from scratch
such that induced grammars impact updates to these representations
throughout learning. Thus, in addition to semantic bootstrapping, our
model has the possibility of performing syntactic bootstrapping by

Our proposal
In this paper, we make the following theoretical proposal: linguistic bootstrapping follows from joint learning over multiple levels of
linguistic representation, via simultaneous access to multiple input
modalities. We argue that neither syntactic nor semantic bootstrapping
are independent learning strategies, as they have previously been presented, but both learning effects which arise as a consequence of a
probabilistic joint learning strategy over both syntactic and semantic
levels of representation for language, highlighting instead their interdependence. In other words, these bootstrapping effects simply arise from
wanting to learn word meanings and language structure at the same
time. Furthermore, we propose that no prior linguistic knowledge is
necessary beyond a bias towards learning abstract categories (syntactic
or conceptual), to acquire both syntactic and semantic representations.
Learning syntactic structures can facilitate learning word and sentence meanings, and conversely, learning meanings can facilitate learning syntactic structures. In a joint inference process over both syntactic
and semantic representations, each hypothesis space can constrain the
other and help learners to simultaneously acquire syntax and semantics.
In the sections which follow, we will use a neural visual grammar
induction model to show how constraints during joint inference on one
linguistic domain can affect another and lead to better generalization in
completely novel contexts.6 Our model learns grounded representations
of both syntactic structure and semantic meanings from sentenceimage pairs using a statistical learning algorithm. We ask the following
questions: 1. (analogous to semantic bootstrapping) Can access to
visual-grounding and the ability to learn semantic representations in
a joint learning setting facilitate learning grammars that generalize
better to unseen contexts? 2. (analogous to syntactic bootstrapping)
Can access to linguistic structure and the ability to learn grammar in
a joint learning setting facilitate learning and interpreting novel words
and contexts?
The dataset
For all of the demonstrations and experiments reported in this
paper, we use the Abstract Scenes dataset (Zitnick & Parikh, 2013;
Zitnick, Parikh, & Vanderwende, 2013), a dataset composed of clipart scenes meant to resemble children’s book illustrations paired with
simple sentences narrating the contents of the images, Fig. 2 contains
examples of these image-sentence pairs.
Previous work on visually-grounded grammar induction has used
image-caption pairs from datasets like MS-COCO (Chen et al., 2015;

The joint-learning model

Lin et al., 2014); the problem with image captions is that they are not
always complete sentences, but often complex noun phrase descriptions
which lack main verbs, for example ‘‘A man sitting on a park bench
with an umbrella’’. For this work, it was important to use imagesentence pairs with complete sentences containing main verbs. Much of
the existing literature on linguistic bootstrapping, especially syntactic
bootstrapping, has centered on the acquisition of verb meaning using
argument structure. Furthermore, not having access to main verbs
enough may bias grammar induction models towards trees that favor
different words as sentence heads.
The images and sentences from Abstract Scenes contain depictions
and descriptions of actions with both transitive and intransitive main
verbs that lend themselves well to syntactic and semantic bootstrapping
experimentation. This dataset has also been used before in modeling
experiments for language acquisition research (Nikolaus & Fourtassi,
2021a, 2021b). In total it contains 10,020 images each paired with 6
different sentences, for a total of 60,160 image-sentence pairs.

Our joint-learning model must learn both syntactic and semantic
knowledge from grounded linguistic input. As mentioned in the introduction, a family of models which lend themselves well to learning
explicit grammatical representations are neural grammar induction
models. In particular, since we would like to eventually have syntactic
and semantic representations of acquired knowledge that can effect
one another through bootstrapping-like mechanisms during learning,
we need our grammar induction model to be semantically grounded in
some way. For this reason, we base our model on a visually-grounded
grammar induction model called VC-PCFG (visually-grounded compound probabilistic context-free grammar) by Zhao and Titov (2020).
Our joint-learning model combines two types of learning objectives
together: (1) a syntactic learning objective and (2) a semantic learning
objective, respectively trying to learn syntactic and semantic knowledge from visually grounded linguistic input. We describe each of these
objective in the subsections which follow.

Test–train splits

The syntactic objective

The Abstract Scenes Dataset does not come with preexisting data
splits, so we designed our own to evaluate syntactic and semantic
bootstrapping on in-distribution syntactic structure learning and outof-distribution verb learning.
For the out-of-distribution experiment presented in Section ‘‘Experiment 2: Syntactic bootstrapping and joint learning’’, we created a
test split that contained image-sentence pairs with novel main verbs.
In other words, if the model was trained on instances of throw, kiss,
cry it was then evaluated on toss, hug, smile. The latter verbs can be
considered nonce verbs from the perspective of the model. To create
our test data, we first extracted all of the main verbs with more than 5
instances in the dataset (around 480 verbs), grouped them by verb stem
(280 unique verb stems), annotated them for transitivity and object
animacy. We then hand selected 10 intransitive verb stems and 10 transitive stems taking animate objects and 10 taking inanimate objects.
We selected these verbs such that they appeared in varied sentential
contexts (i.e. there were no synomyms or closely related verbs) and
such that the total number of transitive and intransitive sentences were
as close as possible. The training and test verb stem lists are available in
Appendix ‘‘Verb stem lists for data split’’. In total, the test set contained
1708 sentences (718 transitive, 990 intransitive) with 30 different
held out verb stems (10 transitive-animate, 10 transitive-inanimate, 10
intransitive).
For experiments in Section ‘‘Experiment 1: Semantic bootstrapping
and joint learning’’ with in-distribution tests, we simply reintroduced
half of the test set to training, so that all verbs were now seen at least
once during training, resulting in 833 test sentences (357 transitive,
476 intransitive) with 30 different verb stems. Thus, test sentences in
these in-distribution evaluation were novel sentences containing known
verbs.

We will represent syntactic knowledge as a compound probabilistic
context free grammar, or C-PCFG (Kim et al., 2019). C-PCFGs are extensions of probabilistic context free grammars (PCFGs). A PCFG, ⟨, 𝝅⟩
is a grammar  coupled with 𝝅, a probability function over . Here,
the context free grammar can be formalized as a 5-tuple of finite sets
 = (𝑆 ,  , , 𝛴 , ), where 𝑆 is the start symbol,  the nonterminal
categories,  the preterminal categories, 𝛴 the vocabulary or set of
terminals, and  the production rules over words and categories. The
rules in  are in Chomsky normal form:
𝑆 → 𝐴,

𝐴 ∈ ,

𝐴 → 𝐵𝐶 ,

𝐴 ∈  , 𝐵 , 𝐶 ∈  ∪ ,

𝑇 → 𝑤,

𝑇 ∈ , 𝑤 ∈ 𝛴 .

The probability function 𝝅 assigns some non-negative value to every
production rule 𝑟 ∈ . In most PCFGs, it is defined as a set of categorical probability distributions where there is a separate categorical for
∑
every set of rules with the same left-hand side such that 𝛼∣𝐴→𝛼 𝜋(𝐴 →
𝛼) = 1. However, as shown in Kim et al. (2019), the strong contextfree assumption instantiated by this type of probability function is not
conducive to effectively inducing a grammar from scratch. Instead, we
need a way to share information across rule applications in a tree. The
proposed solution in Kim et al. (2019) is the C-PCFG, which assumes
that rule probabilities 𝝅 follow a compound distribution (Robbins,
1951). In such a distribution we additionally condition each rule probability on some contextual information, here a latent representation
of the complete sentence’s meaning that we will call 𝐳. Intuitively,
𝐳 represents shared information in each sentence that is accessible
throughout its tree derivations at each rule application. C-PCFGs rule
probabilities are thus not strictly independent of one another. C-PCFGs

are in fact a mixture of PCFGs, satisfying the context-free assumption
when conditioned on some value for the random variable 𝐳, here an
abstract representation for the overall meaning of a sentence. Access to
additional information in the form of this sentence-level representation
turns out to be crucial for successful grammar induction,7 making what
used to be a very hard problem – inducing a grammar from scratch
– solvable. In practice, we will sample a 𝐳 from a spherical Gaussian
distribution with prior parameters 𝛾 for each sentence in our input.

We can therefore fully define our syntactic objective as:
∑
ELBO(𝑠; 𝜙, 𝜃 , 𝛾)
syntax (; 𝜙, 𝜃 , 𝛾) = −

This objective will induce a C-PCFG, ⟨, 𝝅⟩, by estimating the maximum log-likelihood of each sentence in our corpus  using the variational inference method. This approach amounts to turning the grammar induction problem into a parameter estimation problem, which
we can effectively do via gradient descent using our neural network
implementation.
In practice, we allow our grammar  to contain up to 30 nonterminal categories, 60 pre-terminals, and a vocabulary of 2000 terminals/words.10 These numbers means that there are a total of up to
120,000 (60 × 2000) terminal rules, 243,000 (30 × (30 + 60) × (30
+ 60)) non-terminal rules, and 30 root rules in our grammar. During
grammar induction the model should quickly learn which of these rules
are productive and thus more likely, narrowing down our grammar to
a small subset of them in the end.

𝐳 ∼ Spher icalGaussian(𝛾),

Additionally, in a neural C-PCFG we use embeddings rather than
symbols such as ‘‘VP’’ or ‘‘N’’ to represent all our possible left and
right-hand sides of rules. Thus, we must parameterize the probability
of each individual rule using embeddings, where 𝐮, 𝐰 will represent
embeddings for possible left and right-hand sides of rules respectively.
Our C-PCFG, ⟨, 𝝅⟩, defines a compound probability distribution over
rules using the following process (note that all rule probabilities are

The semantic objective
We would like to represent semantic knowledge as a semantic
embedding space, where visual information paired with syntactic forms
can be encoded. To learn such a space, we take inspiration from
previous work on vision-language model encoders (VLMs), such as
CLIP (Radford et al., 2021). VLMs learn a joint text and image semantic
embedding space by trying to maximize the similarity between text
embeddings and image embeddings in sentence-image pairs (Kiros,
Salakhutdinov, & Zemel, 2014). Unlike with VLMs, we do not want
to simply take a text embedding for a complete sentence, but instead
would like to have a way to represent the syntactic structure of a
sentence in our embedding space as well. Thus, we now define the
procedure for determining the similarity between an image and the
predicted syntactic structure of a paired sentence.
First, we need a way to embed images. In previous work, this was
done by taking the final layer of a pretrained vision model, such as
ResNet-101, as an image embedding (Shi et al., 2019; Zhao & Titov,
2020). However, ResNet models like most vision models are trained
in a supervised manner using class labels for images. In other words,
these representations already encode categorical biases towards specific
lexical terms. Given that our joint learning model serves as a cognitive
model, we want to avoid introducing any initial linguistic biases into
image representations. Thus, we train our own vision network on our
dataset using an unsupervised learning algorithm called SimCLR (Chen,
Kornblith, Norouzi, & Hinton, 2020) which requires no class labels at
all.11 We then extract an unbiased set of all image representations 
from our custom vision model, here a custom pretrained self-supervised
ResNet-50 model, 𝚗𝚎𝚝image :

(2)

where [⋅; ⋅] is vector concatenation. 𝑓𝑡 (⋅) and 𝑓𝑠 (⋅) are multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) which are used to encode root and terminal rules.8
We have defined the form encoded syntactic knowledge will take
as a C-PCFG, ⟨, 𝝅⟩. We now define the procedure by which the model
will learn, or induce, it. Here is our syntactic learning objective.
During grammar induction, our objective is to find the 𝝅, or set of
rule probabilities, that maximizes the likelihood of each sentence in our
corpus, 𝑠 ∈ . The likelihood of a sentence under our C-PCFG is the
sum of the probability of every possible tree derivation 𝑡 for 𝑠 under
our grammar  and conditioned on 𝐳, or more formally:
∑ ∏
𝑝𝜃 (𝑠|𝐳) =
𝜋𝐳 (𝑟)
(3)
𝑡∈ (𝑠) 𝑟∈𝑡

where 𝜃 represents the parameters of our grammar model,  (𝑠) is the
set of all derivations for 𝑠, and 𝑡 the set of rules in a given tree 𝑡.
Since our learning objective is to maximize the likelihood of a each
sentence irrespective of 𝐳, we will need to marginalize over 𝐳, taking
the following integral:
∑ ∏
𝜋𝐳 (𝑟)𝑝𝛾 (𝐳)𝑑𝐳
𝑝𝜃 (𝑠) =
∫𝐳
𝑟∈𝑡
𝑡∈ (𝑠)

(5)

𝑠∈



However, computing this integral is intractable. Instead, we can estimate a the log-likelihood of a sentence using variational Bayesian
inference, by finding the maximum evidence lower bound (ELBO):

 = 𝚗𝚎𝚝image (),

log 𝑝𝜃 (𝑠) ≥ ELBO(𝑠; 𝜙, 𝜃 , 𝛾) = E𝑞𝜙 (𝐳|𝑠) [log 𝑝𝜃 (𝑠|𝐳)] − KL[𝑞𝜙 (𝐳|𝑠) ∥ 𝑝𝛾 (𝐳)], (4)

where  are the images. These pretrained embeddings are fixed, so we
do not want to directly apply our semantic objective to them. Instead,

where 𝑞𝜙 (𝐳|𝑠) is our variational approximation of the posterior parameterized by 𝜙, in practice computed using another neural network.9

For the specifics of its implementation see Appendix ‘‘Model implementation’’.
10
The number of categories is based on previous work (Kim et al., 2019;
Zhao & Titov, 2020). We also tested other values (20,40) and did not find that
it affected the results significantly. The vocabulary size was based on the number of unique words in our dataset, discounting typos. Other hyperparameters
are available as the default settings in our code repository [Anonymized].
11
SimCLR is a visual contrastive learning algorithm which works in the
following way: given some target image, create a transformed version by
randomly applying some set of image transformations such as crop, rotate,
distort color, and/or add Gaussian noise. Then, over the course of training try
to maximize the similarity of target and transformed images embedding pairs
while minimizing the similarity with unmatched distractor images.

7

A reviewer asked whether such an assumption should be considered
cognitively plausible and we think this is a fair question. Human languages
are thought to be context-sensitive languages (Shieber, 1985), meaning shared
contextual information is likely necessary to learn some of their rules. A
fairer question may thus be whether complete context-freeness is cognitively
plausible. The assumptions made with C-PCFGs find themselves somewhere in
the middle: benefiting from the efficiency context-free rules offer for grammar
induction over context-sensitive ones, but having some contextual information
available in the form of a single shared whole-sentence representation.

Following Kim et al. (2019), no such MLP is used with non-terminal rules.

architectures.

we would like to have representations which are mutable during the
course of language learning. We thus make a distinction between
our image representations and semantic representations, analogous
to the distinction between visual perception, which is independent
of language, and abstract representation and categorization of visual
features, which may be influenced by language. We extract a semantic
representation 𝐦 from each image embedding 𝐯 ∈  using our semantic
encoder 𝑓𝑚 , a trainable MLP:

Joint-learning model: Simply put, the model optimizes both the syntactic objective and the semantic objective at the same time during
training, giving us the joint loss:
joint (, ; 𝜙, 𝜃 , 𝛾) = 𝛼1 ⋅ syntax (; 𝜙, 𝜃 , 𝛾) + 𝛼2 ⋅ semantics (, ; 𝜃),

where 𝛼1 , 𝛼2 are constants, here both equal to 1. Since the syntactic
and semantic objectives are interdependent, during learning they will
affect the joint model’s learning trajectory by mutually constraining
updates to the grammar and the semantic embedding space. On the
one hand, the semantic objective will push the grammar model to
favor rules which derive trees containing constituents that can be more
easily visually represented. This is because the semantic objective maximizes the similarity between representations of word spans and images
weighted by the marginal probability of word spans. Thus, there are
two ways to increase it: (1) updating the parameter values of matched
word span and image embeddings to be closer in semantic space and/or
(2) increasing the weight or marginal likelihood of word span embeddings that are already similar to their semantic counterparts. On the
other hand, the syntactic objective will determine the distribution over
constituents being mapped to semantic space. Again, this is because
the semantic objective is weighted by the marginal probability of word
spans under the grammar. The grammar is updated as a function of the
syntactic objective, which in turn determines the marginal likelihood
of word spans for the semantic objective. We illustrate the model and
the interconnected relation between objectives in Fig. 3.
In using our model as a cognitive model, we are making the following assumptions about the acquisition of syntactic and semantic
knowledge: (1) we start with the prior knowledge that there are such
things as syntactic categories (though what they represent and how
many there are is unknown); (2) grammatical structure can be represented by a PCFG; (3) meaning is grounded in visual representations.
The first assumption is feasible under most linguistic theories and
theories of acquisition. The second and third, are likely simplifications of children’s learning environment: PCFGs may not have enough
explanatory power for natural language (Huybregts, 1984; Shieber,
1985), and children ground language in embodied experiences going
way beyond still images. By definition, a model is a simplified exemplification of a process. We acknowledge that our model does not
capture all the complexities present in a child’s naturalistic learning
environment. However, we are using our model to study specific research questions and not language learning as a whole. We believe
that this joint-learning model can demonstrate how joint learning
objectives for language can aid language acquisition overall and explain
bootstrapping phenomena, like syntactic and semantic bootstrapping.

𝐦 = 𝑓𝑚 (𝐯).
Second, for our semantic objective we must have a way to compare
the similarity of our semantic image representations to the predicted
syntactic structure of sentences. Following previous work, instead of
using a text encoder for whole sentences, we encode each constituent
in a sentence independently and compare them to our semantic representation 𝐦 (Shi et al., 2019; Zhao & Titov, 2020). In practice, to
ensure that our joint learning model is fully differentiable, we do this
comparison with every possible word span in a sentence and then
weigh each word span’s relative importance by its marginal likelihood
under the induced grammar – higher likelihood spans most likely being
relevant constituents, while low probability ones most likely being
irrelevant.
Thus, we define a semantic objective for a single sentence-image
pair (𝑠, 𝐦) as follows:
∑
mat ch(𝑐 , 𝐦|𝜃),
(6)
𝓁pair (𝑠, 𝐦|𝜃) =
𝑐∈spans(𝑠)

where 𝐜 is a possible constituent, or word span, and spans(⋅) is a function
which returns all possible spans of consecutive words from sentence 𝑠
of length 𝑙 where 1 < 𝑙 < |𝑠|, and recall 𝜃 are the grammar model
parameters. As for our mat ch(⋅, ⋅) function, it is a weighted version of
the contrastive loss traditionally used in training VLMs:
mat ch(𝑐 , 𝐦|𝜃) = 𝑝𝜃 (𝑐|𝑠, 𝐳)ℎ(𝚋𝚒𝙻𝚂𝚃𝙼(𝑐), 𝐦),

(10)

(7)

where 𝑝𝜃 (𝑐|𝑠, 𝐳) is the marginal probability of a constituent, or its
overall probability across all possible 𝑡 ∈  (𝑠),12 which weighs the
hinge loss function, ℎ(𝚋𝚒𝙻𝚂𝚃𝙼(𝑐), 𝐦). We encode each constituent independently using a single-layered biLSTM language model. The hinge
loss – a traditional contrastive learning loss used with VLMs – then
tries to maximize the similarity between matched constituent representations and semantic representations, while minimizing the similarity of
unmatched pairs:
[
]
ℎ(𝐜, 𝐦) = simcos (𝐜′ , 𝐦) − simcos (𝐜, 𝐦) + 𝜖 +
[
]
+ simcos (𝐜, 𝐦′ ) − simcos (𝐜, 𝐦) +𝜖 + ,
(8)
where 𝐜 is the constituent representation, [⋅]+ = max(0, ⋅), 𝜖 is a constant
margin, and 𝐜′ , 𝐦′ are negative examples, or unmatched constituent
and meaning representations from a different sentence-image pair. Intuitively, we want our model to learn to represent semantic knowledge in
an semantic embedding space where matched constituent-image pairs
are closer in space than unmatched ones.
The complete semantic objective is then simply the sum of the
pairwise objective across all sentence-image pairs.
∑
semantics (, ; 𝜃) =
𝓁pair (𝑠(𝑗) , 𝑓𝑚 (𝐯(𝑗) ); 𝜃)
(9)

Semantics-first model: Our first ablated model starts by optimizing the
semantic objective only. Since this model does not initially have access to syntax or predicted structures, it uses the similarity between
whole sentences and images, as opposed to the similarity between the
constituents and an image.13 In other words, it uses the traditional
image-caption matching loss used in VLM models like CLIP (Radford
et al., 2021), having access to only the order in which words appeared
but no structure beyond that. Halfway through training, we add the
syntactic objective, resulting in the regular joint-learning objective.
This first ablation will help us understand the impact of having access
or not to syntactic representations from the start of learning, showing us what happens when semantic knowledge is initially acquired
independently of syntactic knowledge.

𝑗

The complete model and ablations
Now that we have defined both how syntactic and semantic knowledge is represented and how we can learn these representations via our
syntax and semantics objectives, we can bring all these components
together in our joint-learning model. We will additionally consider
some ablated versions of the model to better understand the role of
each of these components over the course of joint learning.

13
We also tried a version that uses the semantic loss defined above but
found that it made no difference in model performance, though it required
much more computation. This is because the C-PCFG is initialized uniformly,
meaning all rules have equal likelihood and thus all possible trees or spans
of equal length are equally likely. Since the C-PCFG does not update for the
first half of training in the semantics-first model, staying uniformly distributed,
nothing is gained from applying the loss over spans as opposed to the whole
sentence.

12
To see how we can derive this value from our derivation tree distribution
𝑝𝜃 (𝑡|𝑠, 𝐳) over trees for 𝑠, see Zhao and Titov (2020).

Syntax-first model: Our second ablated model is initially trained solely
on the syntactic objective, or without visual grounding, in other words
using the original C-PCFG grammar induction objective from Kim et al.
(2019). Halfway through training, we add the semantic objective,
resulting once again in the regular joint-learning objective. This second
ablation allows us to determine the impact of having access or not to
semantic representations from the start of learning, showing us what
happens when syntactic knowledge is initially acquired independently
of semantic knowledge.
By comparing the joint-learning model to the syntax-first and
semantics-first ones, we hope to demonstrate the importance of an interdependence between syntactic and semantic representation learning,
supporting our proposal for a unified view of bootstrapping theories.
Finally, we compare the joint-learning model to a model with oracle
knowledge of image content, which we call the visual-labels model.

grammars than the syntax-first model and that the joint-learning model
should show less variation across runs than the semantics-first or
syntax-first models.
Evaluations
To determine what makes an induced grammar a better grammar,
we report two evaluations. The first follows previous work in grammar
induction and compares the internal branching structure, excluding the
root and leaf branches (which are deterministic), of the most likely
parse for each sentence under the induced grammars to gold standard parses. We also compare our models to fully left-branching and
fully right-branching baselines. The second evaluation compares the
induced pre-terminal categories of models to gold syntactic categories
to determine whether the induced categories over words correspond to
syntactic categories traditionally used in linguistics. This second evaluation is inspired by semantic bootstrapping theory, which was intended
to explain both how children learn syntactic primitives, especially
formal categories over words, and what distributional information they
must attend to in their input to do so Pinker (1984). We can compare
the impact of visual-grounding and objective functions on the models
ability to induce meaningful syntactic categories, following Pinker’s
proposal for a model of direct evidence of the semantic bootstrapping
hypothesis.
The gold parses, or rather in this case silver parses, were automatically extracted using the Berkeley Neural Parser (Benepar) (Kitaev,
Cao, & Klein, 2019; Kitaev & Klein, 2018), which derives constituency
parses for sentences and uses part-of-speech tags from the SpaCy library (spaCy, 2020) as lexical categories. This approach is also taken
in Shi et al. (2019) and Zhao and Titov (2020). To create a correspondence between the part-of-speech tags on these parse trees and
syntactic categories, we used a custom mapping provided in Appendix
‘‘Syntactic category mappings’’. We train five different random seed
runs for each model.

Visual-labels model: This model is trained using the same objective as
the joint-learning model, however, instead of using image representations from our unsupervised pretrained image vision model, it uses
label vectors which we extracted using the Abstract Scenes metadata.
These label vectors encode the coordinates and rotation of all objects
and agents in images, as well as the physical position and facial expression presented by agents. Our unsupervised pretrained image encodings
may not have learnt to extract all of the information contained in the
label vectors. Thus, the visual-labels model can give us a sense for how
important the clear perception of referents is for our evaluation tasks.
Experiment 1: Semantic bootstrapping and joint learning
This experiment answers our first research question: can access to
visual-grounding and the ability to learn semantic representations in
a joint learning setting facilitate learning grammars that generalize
better to unseen contexts? In other words, akin to semantic bootstrapping, does having access to visual-grounding, or the ability to map
visual meanings to strings, help models learn syntactic categories and
productive syntactic rules over language. We compare four models,
the joint-learning model, the semantics-first model, the syntax-first
model, and the visual-labels model. For each model we train five
versions from different random seeds. Based on Pinker (1984) proposal,
access to semantic representations is the basis for learning meaningful
syntactic categories. We thus expect models with access to semantic
representations from the start to learn more meaningful grammars over
language, with syntactic categories that better mirror those described in
language acquisition and linguistic theories. Furthermore, we hypothesize that joint learning helps constrain the hypothesis space considered
over grammars leading to less variation across model runs. We thus
expect the joint-learning and the semantics-first models to learn better

Results
Evaluating syntactic structure
We compare the induced trees on the in-distribution test sentences
to gold parses, as well as to fully left-branching and right-branching
trees. We use a standard metric for this comparison: mean span F1
score across trees. The span F1 score of a predicted tree is calculated
by considering all the intermediate constituents of more that one word
in a sentence as determined by its branches. Fig. 4 demonstrates this
process. We report final scores in Table 1. The model which induces
trees closest to the gold parses is the joint-learning model. Given

phrase (DP) debates in theoretical linguistics (Köylü, 2021). Another
difference seems to be in the treatment of coordinate structures in
subject position, where predicted trees have the first conjunct selecting
for the sentence containing the second conjunct as subject, instead of
having the conjunction as a whole serving as subject.
Comparing induced syntactic categories
The first evaluation considered the quality of the induced grammar. In this second evaluation, we look at the pre-terminal or lexical
categories having been learnt over words. We compared the induced
categories for words in predicted parses, to the syntactic categories
associated with words in the gold parses. Since each random seed run
may learn a different mapping between categories, we first consider
each run separately and visualize how well predicted categories map
to gold ones using a normalized contingency table. In Fig. 7, we plot
the proportion of words in each syntactic category that was mapped to
a given pre-terminal category — of which there were up to 60.15
With the exception of the syntax-first model, others seem to distribute the majority of words into 10 to 20 pre-terminal categories. In
the case of the joint model, most syntactic categories map to distinct
sets of pre-terminals, suggesting that the model was able to learn
syntactically meaningful lexical categories over words. There is some
overlap between nouns, proper nouns, and pronouns, though since
these types of words tend to occupy similar syntactic positions, it is
not too surprising. The semantics-first, syntax-first, and visual-labels
models were also able to induce meaningful lexical categories. We note
that the syntax-first model seems not to have any clear correspondence
in its pre-terminals to verbs. Since verbs are so important to sentential
structure, the lack of a clear verb category or set of categories may
in part explain why this model also fails to induce grammars which
resemble our gold parse grammar in the first evaluation.
Additionally, we measure the quality of models’ induced lexical
categories using V-measure, an entropy-based cluster evaluation metric (Rosenberg & Hirschberg, 2007). Similarly to F-scores, V-measure is
a weighted harmonic mean of two cluster quality metrics, homogeneity
and completeness.16 Intuitively, homogeneity measures how well induced lexical categories map to labeled syntactic categories (i.e. do all
words in C52 map to a single syntactic category, like modal?), while
completeness measures how well labeled syntactic categories map to
induced lexical categories (i.e. do all words labeled adjective map to a
single pre-terminal category, say C35?). Given that we are interested in
inducing homogeneous lexical categories where words all share particular syntactic properties, this measure matters most to us. Completeness

that these are English sentences, the gold parses are quite similar to
right branching trees, with on average 85% of internal branch span
correspondence. These scores are taken after 30 epochs of learning,
though in Fig. 5, we additionally plot the changes in mean span F1
scores between predicted trees and gold parses throughout learning for
each model. The vertical dashed line in this figure marks the halfway
point where syntax-first and semantics-first models switch to a jointlearning objective (adding in either the semantic loss or the syntactic
loss respectively). Joint learning clearly leads models to successfully
induce grammars over language. Whether joint learning is paired with
the self-supervised image embedding or with the gold label image embeddings (visual-labels model), does not seem to matter. Interestingly,
with the semantics-first model, which is simply at chance for the first
half of learning since it does not yet have access to the syntax loss
for learning grammar, we see that once we introduce the joint loss,
it is able to learn reasonable grammars, however there is much more
variation across runs. This observation supports the hypothesis that
joint learning is in part most successful because it can lead to mutual
constraining of the hypothesis space for both syntactic and semantic
learning. As for the syntax-first model, without the availability of visual
grounding initially, it induces grammars that are very different from
the one used for the gold parses.14 Even once visual grounding is made
available at the halfway point, the model can no longer recover, having
limited itself to a certain hypothesis space over categories and rules that
is too far from those used in deriving the gold parses.
In Fig. 6, we compare example induced trees from the joint-learning
model to the respective gold parses to see where differences lie. One
of the main differences is in noun phrases with adjectives, where we
can clearly see that predicted trees have determiners subordinate to
nouns, while gold parses have nouns subordinate to determiners. This
difference is reminiscent of the noun phrase (NP) versus determiner

The same plots for other random seeds as well as additional analyses using
mean Jensen–Shannon divergence between predicted and annotated category
distributions are available in Appendix ‘‘Syntactic category mappings’’.

All these measures are bounded between 0 and 1, where in general higher
values are considered better.

14
Though these results may seem low, they are in line with previous findings
on other corpora, where non-visually grounded C-PCFG mean F1 branching
scores range between 0.36 and 0.55 (Kim et al., 2019; Zhao & Titov, 2020).

may matter less here since the level of precision of our labeled syntactic
categories is arbitrary and models may in fact be inducing more precise
categories — for example, had we chosen to separate the category
verb into more subcategory labels such as transitives, intransitives, and
ditransitives, it is possible that completeness would then be higher. We
report mean V-measure, homogeneity, and completeness across model
runs in Table 2.
The results in Table 2 confirm that all models were able to learn
meaningful lexical categories and that joint learning can lead to successful syntactic category learning. We note that the syntax-first model
had the lowest homogeneity measure, while the semantics-first and

visual-labels models had the highest.17 This observation further suggests that access to visual grounding early in learning as a proxy for
semantic meaning can improve a model’s ability to learn syntactically
relevant lexical categories, as predicted by semantic bootstrapping
theory.

Evaluations
There are two evaluations for this experiment: The first involves
matching a novel sentence containing a never before seen verb to visual
scenes (see Fig. 8), the second involves matching a visual scene to
sentences which are minimally different, only interchanging semantic
roles (see Fig. 9).
The first evaluation is an out-of-distribution test done with models
for which we have withheld all test sentences containing the 30 different verb stems (10 transitive-animate, 10 transitive-inanimate, 10
intransitive) from their training data. The sentences containing these
held out stems served as test sentences to evaluate whether or not
models could interpret novel verbs and contexts by correctly identifying
the corresponding images from a pair of images. The test examples are
constructed by pairing one transitive sentence with an intransitive one,
where their respective images then serve as each other’s target and
distractor images. This test is based on the previously mentioned nonce
verb learning experimental paradigm shown in Fig. 1. We note that our
evaluation does differ in some ways. Since our test examples are built
using existing images and sentences from the Abstract scenes dataset,
they are not necessarily minimal pairs, so it is possible at times to use
additional sentential cues to help correctly identify the target image.
For example, in Fig. 8, models could use the presence of the adverb
‘happily’ to help pick the correct image, since in the distractor image,
Mike does not seem happy. Our evaluation setup however allows us
to have many test items, 1436 to be exact. We cannot fully control
for additional factors beyond the syntactic structure surrounding novel
verbs contributing to models correctly matching sentences to images.
For this reason, we additionally introduce a second evaluation.
Syntactic bootstrapping theory argues that children can use their
understanding of argument structure and semantic roles to help them

Experiment 2: Syntactic bootstrapping and joint learning
In this experiment we answer our second research question: can
access to linguistic structure and the ability to learn grammar in a
joint learning setting facilitate learning and interpreting novel words
and contexts? Akin to syntactic bootstrapping, we would like to test if
syntactic structure can help models interpret novel word meanings in
context. Like in our first experiment, we compare four models: the jointlearning model, the semantics-first model, the syntax-first model, and
the visual-labels model, training five versions from different random
seeds. This experiment is inspired by experimental designs from studies
on syntactic bootstrapping (Fisher et al., 2020). We hypothesize that
joint learning and access to syntactic structure should better a model’s
ability to interpret novel words and contexts. Therefore, we expect
joint-learning models – both the visual-labels model and joint-learning
model with self-supervised image embeddings – to perform best, while
the semantics-first and syntax-first models should see an increase in
performance after introducing joint learning.

17
A t-test between the semantics-first and syntax-first confirms that this
difference is significant (t ([4]) = [4.58], p = [>0.05]), though not for the
visual-labels model (t ([4]) = [2.46], p = [0.06]).

We then return the cosine similarity between our tree representation

We report the average proportion of correctly identified target
images, or the mean matching score, across 5 random seed models and
1436 test items. We plot models’ matching scores throughout training
in Fig. 10. Chance performance is 0.5 since this is a balanced binary
choice task.
All models successfully learn to map novel verb sentences to their
respective images the majority of the time. We note that the visuallabels model which has gold labels as visual encodings for image
content does much better than other models. All the other models as
previously described use self-supervised visual encodings which may
not have learnt to encode all the necessary visual information. Still,
we see that the joint-model’s performance consistently increases while
both the syntax-first (at chance initially since it has no access to visual
encodings) and the semantics-first models see a jump in performance
after the introduction of the joint-learning loss at the half way point.19
Performing a paired t-test for the semantics-first model right before
and after having introduced joint learning confirms that this jump is
significant (t ([4]) = [5.04], p = [>0.01]).
We additionally plot model performance with respect to target novel
verbs being either transitive or intransitive in Fig. 11, each with 718

interpret and learn the meanings of novel verbs (Gleitman, 1990). To
determine if models have learnt to distinguish semantic roles and thus
whether they could be using a similar strategy to correctly interpret
novel verbs in the first evaluation, we use a second follow up evaluation
taken from Nikolaus and Fourtassi (2021a), illustrated in Fig. 9. Here,
models are given an image with a transitive action and two minimally
different sentences, only differing in that the agent and patient roles
have been reversed. Models must then correctly identify the sentence
which contains the appropriate semantic role assignment based on the
image. This second evaluation is an in-distribution test using carefully
constructed sentence minimal pairs with known verbs that were not
in the original Abstract Scenes dataset. It is more controlled and can
pinpoint how much models understand about the argument structure
of known verbs and their semantic roles, however it has only 50 test
items.

18
In the case of the semantics first model, for the first half of training, we
simply use the complete sentence embedding 𝚋𝚒𝙻𝚂𝚃𝙼(𝑠) as the test sentence
representation to speed up evaluation time. We also tried using the tree
representation, but found it made no difference for results since in the
semantics first model, the grammar is initially uniformly distributed – meaning
that all rules are equally likely, and thus all of trees for a sentence are equally
likely as well – having therefore no effect on the relative ranking of the images
to sentence similarity scores.
19
Astute readers will have noticed that though the syntax-first model saw
no improvement after the introduction of joint learning in experiment 1 on
semantic bootstrapping in Section ‘‘Experiment 1: Semantic bootstrapping
and joint learning’’, here the syntax-first model does catch up after the
introduction of joint learning. This observation suggests that is not so much
the particular verb phrase structure we learn for transitive and intransitive
verbs that matters for syntactic bootstrapping (e.g. ‘‘[Agent [verb [Patient]]]’’
and ‘‘[Agent [verb]]’’), but simply that they be distinguishable, for example
‘‘[[[Agent] verb] [Patient]]’’ versus ‘‘[[Agent] verb]’’, may not correspond to
our gold parses, but they still make a distinction between verb type structures
and may have relevant constituents to map to semantic representations.

Results
Matching sentences with novel verbs to images
This first evaluation measures how well models can interpret sentences containing novel verbs and whether they can distinguish between transitive and intransitive actions. To determine a model’s preference, we first extract a tree embedding, or a representation of the test
sentence structure under the model, by taking the average of all span
embeddings normalized by their likelihood under the induced grammar

test items. We see no meaningful difference between conditions for the
joint-learning model and syntax-first model. The jump in performance
observed in the previous figure for semantic-first models seems to be in
the transitive condition more prominently. Transitive sentences contain
more structure and require more mastery of semantic roles to properly
interpret them; access to syntactic information via joint learning may

be especially important in this condition, showing evidence of model
behavior that is consistent with the syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis.
Interestingly, the visual-labels model struggles more in the intransitive
condition than the transitive one. Since this difference is not present in
the other models, this observation likely indicates that the visual-labels
model is relying more heavily on additional visual information in some

contexts over syntactic information. Since transitive sentences and their
corresponding images are likely to contain more distinct referents,
especially in the transitive-inanimate object condition, the difference in
performance between these two conditions could be explained by the
model relying on distinctive visual cues (eg. the presence of a soccer
ball in one image versus another). The same does not seem to be true
of other models.
Within the transitive condition, we compare performance between
trials that had an animate (person or animal) or inanimate object in
Fig. 12. We find more evidence in favor of our hypothesis about the
visual-labels model, as it performs a little better in the inanimate condition which contains more distinctive referents. While other models once
again show little difference, learning to correctly respond the majority
of the time regardless of object type. The curves for transitive animate
test items are slightly noisier because there are fewer examples of these
in the test set, 99 over 618 for the inanimate object examples.20

but the visual-labels model are limited by the accuracy of their visual
embeddings. Still, joint learning allows models to successfully learn to
identify semantic roles in a many cases, and when not limited by visual
perception, in most cases.
Discussion
We set out to show via a computational cognitive model that both
semantic bootstrapping and syntactic bootstrapping effects arise as
a result of the interplay between syntactic and semantic knowledge
acquisition during joint learning. Semantic bootstrapping and syntactic
bootstrapping are not necessarily meant to be independent of one
another and in fact, as our experiments suggest, the strongest effects
of syntactic and semantic bootstrapping arise when we view language
learning as a joint inference problem, where both semantics and syntax
are learnt simultaneously.
Akin to semantic bootstrapping, existing works on neural visually/semantically grounded grammar induction (Jin & Schuler, 2020;
Li et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2019; Wan et al., 2022; Zhao & Titov, 2020)
have found that access to images or LLM semantic embeddings can
lead to moderate improvements in grammar induction; in this work,
we found that our visually-grounded joint-learning model saw large
improvements, learning much better grammars than a syntax-first or
syntax-only model. Our large improvements over moderate ones seen in
previous work may be due to the following differences. To start, other
studies used image-caption datasets (e.g. MS-COCO; Chen et al., 2015;
Lin et al., 2014) where captions are not complete sentences with main
verbs for the most part, which may be important when considering
grammar acquisition as a whole. Furthermore, our model not only
learnt the grammar from scratch, but also its visual and semantic
representations, leading to possibly better suited image representations
for semantic bootstrapping like effects to occur. A final difference and
possible limitation to our study is that we used synthetic images while
previous studies used real world images. It is possible that synthetic
images made the task of identifying visual feature easier. Children’s
input is undoubtedly noisier and richer than the data our model was
exposed to, but image-caption datasets are no closer to their learning experience either.21 Given our primary goal: to demonstrate how
the interplay between syntactic and semantic acquisition can follow

Matching semantic roles to images
To determine if models are sensitive to semantic roles, we measure
their ability to distinguish between minimally different sentences containing reversed semantic roles given an image. Like with the previous
evaluation, we first extract tree representations for both the target
and distractor sentences following Eq. (11). We then compare their
similarity scores with the test image using Eq. (13).
𝑦̂𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑒 = max(simcos (𝐭𝐭 𝐚𝐫 𝐠𝐞𝐭 , 𝐦), simcos (𝐭𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐭 𝐫 𝐚𝐜𝐭 𝐨𝐫 , 𝐦))

(13)

We report the average proportion of correct matches across random
seed runs and 50 test items, or models’ mean matching score. Chance
performance is once again 0.5. Fig. 13 shows models’ performance
throughout learning. Neither the syntax-first and semantics first models
do much better than chance at first. This pattern is expected for the
syntax-first model, but for the semantics-first model, it highlights the
importance of syntactic structure for learning semantic roles. Once
joint learning is introduced at the half-way point their performance
starts to increase. The joint-learning model and visual-labels model see
a consistent rise in performance, which plateaus around the halfway
point for the joint-learning model, likely due to the limitations of its
visual encodings.
Given the limited number of test examples, the performance curves
are quite noisy. It is clear that this task is difficult and that all models

21
As one of our reviewers astutely noted, children’s input being noisier
may also mean that in their particular learning contexts joint-learning may
not be possible without stronger syntactic and semantic prior biases. This

from joint learning, using simulated children’s book data presented a
sufficient environment to examine these dynamics.
Akin to syntactic bootstrapping, we found that access to grammatical knowledge over the course of learning increased models’ ability
to interpret novel sentences with never before seen verbs as well
as their ability to recognize different semantic roles. These syntactic
bootstrapping effects were however not as strong as those observed
for semantic bootstrapping. We found that the quality of our visual
representations for images were in part to blame for this discrepancy —
using informative visual labels instead of training visual representations
from scratch significantly helped models interpret novel verbs and
learn semantic roles. In future extensions of this work we hope to
address this limitation by considering other methods for learning visual
representations that may better emulate the visual features that are
salient to children.
Joint learning from the start works because it helps mutually constrain related hypotheses spaces, here grammar and semantic representations. These types of constraints are likely necessary for human
learners who are limited in terms of memory and processing capacity as
well as amount of input evidence. Even with these limitations though,
we learn language and better yet, we learn representations which allow
to generalize and use language in completely novel contexts. The reason
for our learning efficiency and generalization abilities may lie in our
effective learning strategies, which we argue are built on joint learning.
Empirical evidence suggests that semantic and syntactic processing
during language comprehension or production are not separable into
distinct areas of the brain, but instead represent distributed processes
which overlap across a wide region referred to as the language network (Fedorenko, Blank, Siegelman, & Mineroff, 2020; Fedorenko,
Ivanova, & Regev, 2024; Hu et al., 2022; Shain et al., 2024). Furthermore, children’s lexicon and their syntactic production abilities
grow side by side during language development (Bates et al., 1994;
Brinchmann, Braeken, & Lyster, 2019; Frank, Braginsky, Marchman, &
Yurovsky, 2021). These results all support our proposal: that language
learning is joint learning across many levels of linguistic representation.
The acquisition of morphemes, words, syntax, semantics, pragmatics
have for the most part been considered in isolation. However, if language learning is indeed a joint inference problem across many levels
of linguistic structure, then future research in the field should try to
understand how learning biases or constraints within these different
levels arise as a function of joint learning. For example, how does the
acquisition of semantic knowledge affect the acquisition of syntax? or
how does learning morpheme boundaries interplay with the acquisition
of semantic knowledge? Understanding how these constraints arise
and interact, we suggest should be the next key direction in language
learning debates.
Computational modeling is not new to the fields of language development and cognitive science. However, the ability to design models
like the one in this paper as well as the access we now have to
multimodal data—sound, image, video, text— may allow us to revisit
with new perspective many of the research questions we still have
about language learning. We have proposed that a promising way to
do so is to think of language learning as a holistic problem involving
joint inference over many different levels of abstract linguistic representation. We have shown how joint learning does not necessarily make
learning harder, but can make it easier by mutually constraining the
hypotheses being considered by a learner, helping them acquire the
complex systems that are human languages. We hope that this work
may convince other researchers in both cognitive science and AI that an
important new direction for language modeling and learning research
lies in considering the dynamics of joint inference over many input
sources and modalities as well as levels of representation.

Appendix B. Model implementation
All models were trained on A100 Multi-Instance GPU partitions,
using at most 32Gb of GPU memory. Each model took about 18 h to
train and evaluate at each epoch, for 30 epochs.
B.1. 𝑓𝑠 and 𝑓𝑡 syntactic category MLPs
𝑓𝑠 and 𝑓𝑡 are both MLPs with a linear input layer, two layers
with ReLU non-linear activations, and finally an output linear layer.
Their only difference is that the final linear layer output is either over
non-terminal symbols or the vocabulary respectively.

observation highlights that any conclusions made using a model are bound
by the simplifying assumptions made in designing the model and experiments
(as with any modeling work).

In practice the variational posterior is given by a diagonal Gaussian
where the mean and log-variance vectors are given by another biLSTM
with a maxpooled linear output layer over the hidden states, for 𝐳 over
each batch of sentences.

POS tags from SpaCy were mapped to the following syntactic categories using this correspondences in Table 3.

Finally, Fig. 18 plots the mean Jensen–Shannon divergence between
predicted syntactic categories across random seed runs for each model.
The closer values are to zero the more similar category distributions
are. For example, we note that the distributions for proper nouns and
nouns are very close under the joint-learning models, while the same
can be said for nouns and adjectives under the syntax-first model.
