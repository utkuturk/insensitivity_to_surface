Introduction
The retention of spatial information serves as a crucial component of
working memory (WM), as demonstrated by influential works
(Baddeley, 1992; Baddeley & Hitch, 1974; Logie, 1986; Mishkin &
Ungerleider, 1982). Its impact extends to diverse domains of human
cognition, including mathematical abilities (Caviola et al., 2020; Holmes
et al., 2008), social cognition (Parkinson & Wheatley, 2013), and nav­
igation (Blacker et al., 2017; Maguire et al., 1997; Weisberg & New­
combe, 2016). Consequently, WM representations of spatial information
have intrigued vast investigations, encompassing topics such as the role
of space in feature binding within WM (e.g., Heuer & Rolfs, 2021;
Pertzov & Husain, 2014; Schneegans & Bays, 2017), neural correlates
associated with spatial representations in WM (e.g., Alekseichuk et al.,
2016; Foster et al., 2017; Tamura et al., 2017), and factors influencing
WM of spatial information (e.g., Brady & Tenenbaum, 2013; Huang,
2023; Langlois et al., 2021). However, few studies have addressed a
fundamental question: What is the format of spatial representations in
WM, which governs how these representations are manipulated and
utilized (but see Huttenlocher et al., 1991; Yousif et al., 2024). While
these studies have provided preliminary evidence that spatial

information is represented in polar coordinates within WM, it remains
unclear whether this format is constant or flexible. Moreover, these
studies have primarily focused on laboratory settings. Given the
importance of WM spatial representations in real-life tasks such as
navigation, and the potential differences in cognitive mechanisms be­
tween laboratory and real-world tasks (Taylor-Phillips et al., 2024), it is
necessary to explore their format in large-scale environments. To bridge
these gaps, our study aims to investigate the WM format of spatial
representations across both small-scale and large-scale environments.
While various mathematical representations exist for spatial infor­
mation, our study specifically focuses on two common formats: Carte­
sian coordinates (x, y) and polar coordinates (angle, radius). A Cartesian
reference frame represents spatial locations via orthogonal x and y di­
mensions, providing an allocentric encoding of spatial relationship
(Klatzky, 1998). In contrast, a polar reference frame encodes space
based on a radial distance from a central origin point and an angular
direction. This format naturally captures the egocentric spatial re­
lationships experienced from a first-person perspective, with the ob­
server’s current position serving as the reference origin (Klatzky, 1998).
Recent research has highlighted the discernibility of these two formats
through an analysis of the correlation of reproduction errors in the two

dimensions within the same coordinate system (Yousif & Keil, 2021;
Yousif et al., 2024). The underlying rationale stems from the orthogo­
nality of dimensions within both coordinate systems. Specifically, the
noise sources for each underlying coordinate dimension are assumed to
be uncorrelated. Thus, if observers employ a certain coordinate system
to represent space, then unsigned errors in the two dimensions within
that system should be independent or unrelated. For polar representa­
tions, this analytical approach makes further assumptions that unsigned
errors on the x and y axes will exhibit a significant correlation concur­
rently. In contrast, the pattern of polar correlations predicted by Car­
tesian representations depends on specific task details (Yousif et al.,
2024). Thus, polar representations predict both correlated Cartesian
errors and uncorrelated polar errors, whereas Cartesian representations
predict only uncorrelated Cartesian errors. These assumptions are wellsupported by simulation analyses from previous research (Yousif & Keil,
2021; Yousif et al., 2024), which confirm the validity of this approach. A
similar analytical approach has also been applied to differentiate
whether WM stores items as a bound unit or independent features (Bays
et al., 2011). Remarkably, employing this error correlation analysis,
researchers have discovered that spatial information defaults to being
represented in polar coordinates within WM (Yousif et al., 2024).
Additional evidence supporting the utilization of polar coordinates in­
cludes findings from animal studies, where desert ants were revealed to
navigate home by continuously updating their homing direction and
distance (Sommer & Wehner, 2005; Wittlinger et al., 2006).
Beyond these studies, an unresolved question is whether the repre­
sentation of polar coordinates in WM is invariant or operates in a flexible
way. Existing evidence seems to support the latter. For instance, in
perception, Yousif and Keil (2021) found that participants’ mis­
localizations were more consistent with the use of Cartesian coordinates
under grid-like contexts, rather than polar coordinates. Furthermore,
different spatial formats have been identified for representing different
types of information or fulfilling different task demands (Hudson &
Landy, 2012; Park et al., 2020; Peer et al., 2021; Yousif et al., 2024). In
large-scale navigation tasks, task settings have also been revealed to
influence the format of spatial representations (He & Brown, 2019; Peer
et al., 2024). Additionally, researchers have proposed flexible or hybrid
models that integrate the advantageous characteristics of both Euclidean
and topological models for representing space (Chown et al., 1995;
Kuipers, 2000; Mallot & Basten, 2009; Trullier et al., 1997). These
findings collectively imply the flexible use of different spatial formats in
WM. To directly examine the flexibility of spatial representations in
WM, the current study implemented distinct memory contexts. We
examined whether the formats of spatial information varied across these
contexts by employing error correlation analysis. Crucially, we inde­
pendently manipulated contexts during encoding and retrieval stages to
determine the critical stage that governs the utilization of divergent
representation formats.
Moreover, considering the practical implications of spatial infor­
mation in WM, particularly in navigation, arises the question of how
such information is represented in large-scale real-world environments.
While much spatial WM research has been confined to laboratory set­
tings, where encoding and retrieval occur within a limited area on a
computer screen, real-world navigation often involves transitions across
different scales. For instance, in a typical navigation task, individuals
must first memorize spatial locations on a small-scale 2D map and then
locate the target within a larger-scale real-world setting. It remains
uncertain whether spatial information retains its representation as polar
coordinates during this process. Relevant to this issue, massive studies
have examined the structure of spatial knowledge in long-term memory
used for navigation in large-scale spatial systems. Nevertheless, ongoing
debates persist, with various proposals being put forward. One such
proposal is the Euclidean cognitive map, which is akin to Cartesian co­
ordinates (Jacobs et al., 2013; Maidenbaum et al., 2018; O’Keefe &
Nadel, 1978; Siegel & White, 1975). Another proposal is the theory of a
network-like cognitive graph, which emphasizes angle and distance

information, resembling polar coordinates (Kuipers, 1978; Warren,
2019; Warren et al., 2017). To investigate whether spatial information
encoded in a small-scale environment automatically translates into polar
coordinates for navigation in a larger-scale environment, the current
study employs virtual reality (VR) technology to simulate navigation
environment. Through the error correlation analysis, we directly
examine the representation formats of space in large-scale WM. Addi­
tionally, this study examines the flexibility of representation formats.
For that in the large-scale VR environment, participants are unable to
accurately perceive the full scope of the terrain context, and the grid
appears distorted from the participant’s first-person perspective, we did
not examine the influence of context. Instead, we drew inspirations from
prior research (Yousif et al., 2024), which found that the format of
presented information (direct vs. indirect) influenced the representation
format adopted in motor WM. Specifically, we examined how the
response type (direct vs. indirect) modulated the format of spatial rep­
resentations by manipulating participants to reproduce the spatial lo­
cations freely or indirectly within the large-scale scenario.
Taken together, to investigate the WM format of spatial representa­
tions in small and large environments, we conducted a series of exper­
iments. Participants were tasked with reproducing target locations
presented either on a computer screen (small-scale, Experiments 1, 2,
3A, and 3B) or within a VR environment (large-scale, Experiments 4A
and 4B) after memorizing these locations on a 2D display. Experiment 1
investigated the default format of spatial representations in small-scale
WM by manipulating memory contexts as blank. While in Experiment
2, we examined the flexibility of spatial representations by manipulating
memory contexts as grid-like. Furthermore, we independently manipu­
lated memory contexts during encoding (Experiment 3A) and response
phases (Experiment 3B) to determine the critical stages that govern the
utilization of divergent representation formats. Experiment 4 utilized a
VR environment to simulate navigation tasks in large-scale real-world
settings. By manipulating participants’ navigation methods to either
freely (Experiment 4A) or indirectly (Experiment 4B) reach the target
location, we investigated the potential flexibility of representation for­
mats in large-scale spatial memory tasks.

Experiment 1: The default format of spatial representation in
small-scale WM
Experiment 1 employed blank memory contexts (Fig. 1A) to inves­
tigate how spatial information is represented in WM by default. Our aim
was to determine whether participants’ patterns of errors were more
consistent with polar or Cartesian coordinates.
Methods
Participants. Twenty volunteers (11 males and 9 females, aged
18–24) from Sun Yat-sen University participated in this experiment for
payment. All participants were all right-handed and reported normal or
corrected-to-normal visual acuity. The sample size was determined a
priori based on PANGEA (Westfall, 2016). Based on similar designs from
prior studies (Yousif & Keil, 2021; the polar correlation vs. the Cartesian
correlation in Experiment 1a; Cohen’s d = 1.62), we anticipated an ef­
fect size (Cohen’s d) of 1.62 for paired t-tests in our experimental setup.
To achieve at least 95 % power for the effect of paired t-tests at a sig­
nificance level of 0.05, a suggested sample size of 16 was calculated. We
recruited twenty participants for Experiment 1 to ensure robust statis­
tical power.
Before participation, all individuals provided signed informed con­
sent. The study received approval from the Research Ethics Board of Sun

Yat-sen University and was conducted in accordance with the approved
guidelines.
Stimuli and apparatus. The experiment was programmed in Python
with the PsychoPy libraries (Peirce et al., 2019). The experimental
stimuli were presented on a 27-inch LCD monitor (resolution: 2560 ×
1440, refresh rate: 60 Hz) against a grey background (RGB: 128, 128,
128). Participants’ viewing distance from the screen was approximately
57 cm.
The memory stimuli consisted of three shapes − a red square, a blue
circle, and a green triangle, each with a radius of 0.36◦ . For each trial,
the positions of these three shapes were randomly selected within a
range of 4.48◦ horizontally and 4.48◦ vertically relative to the center of
the screen. Besides, a constraint was imposed that the distance between
any two shapes should be more than 1.25◦ .
Procedure and Experimental design. The experimental procedure
was depicted in Fig. 1B. After a 500 ms fixation period, a memory
display featuring three shapes appeared for 800 ms. Participants were
instructed to memorize the positions of these three shapes. Following a
1000 ms blank interval, the fixation reappeared, prompting participants
to click the left mouse button to make the mouse cursor (x) visible.
Subsequently, participants should click the left mouse button again,
causing one randomly chosen shape to appear at the mouse location.
Their task was to place the shape to its corresponding position in the

memory display by clicking the left mouse button. This process can be
repeated multiple times until the right mouse button was clicked, indi­
cating a locked response. Participants then proceeded to click the left
mouse button again to make another memory shape visible and repro­
duce its position in the same manner. The trial ended after all three
shapes have been responded to. Each response must be completed
within 14 s. Otherwise, this trial was skipped, and a warning message
was displayed, urging participants to respond more quickly in the later
responses. Skipped trials would be randomly interleaved into subse­
quent trials.
Each participant completed 192 trials, distributed randomly across
six blocks. Before formal trials, participants underwent 10–15 practice
trials to familiarize themselves with the procedure. The entire task took
approximately 50 min.
Data analysis. The first, second and last responses were analyzed
separately. Responses with reproduction errors (calculated as Euclidean
distance between the target and reported position) exceeding +/- 3
standard deviations (SD) from the participant’s mean error were
excluded from subsequent analyses. We mainly focused on the correla­
tion between the absolute errors in the constitutive dimensions within
each coordinate system. Consequently, correlations were calculated
between the absolute errors in the x and y dimensions, as well as be­
tween the absolute errors in the angle and distance dimensions, for each

compared to 0 using one-sample t-tests. Additionally, a paired t-test was
conducted to compare the two correlation values.

persistently support the advantageous role of polar representations in
WM under default conditions.
Experiment 2: The flexibility of spatial representation formats in
small-scale WM

Results & discussion
1.6 % of responses were removed due to reproduction errors
exceeding +/- 3 standard deviations (SD) from the mean error of each
participant.
First responses: Analysis of the first responses revealed a significant
correlation solely between the absolute errors in the x and y dimensions
(r = 0.16; t(19) = 5.19, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.16, 95 % CI for the mean
= [0.094, 0.222]). In contrast, the correlation between the absolute
errors in the angle and distance dimensions was insignificant (r = 0.03; t
(19) = 1.36, p = .189, Cohen’s d = 0.30, 95 % CI for the mean = [-0.018,
0.083]). Notably, a significant discrepancy emerged between these
correlation values (r = 0.13; t(19) = 5.02, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.12,
95 % CI for the mean = [0.073, 0.178]).
Second and Third responses: In both second and third responses,
significant correlations were observed for Cartesian errors (Second: r =
0.29, t(19) = 7.72, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.73, 95 % CI for the mean =
[0.214, 0.373]; Third: r = 0.26, t(19) = 7.11, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.59,
95 % CI for the mean = [0.181, 0.333]). Polar errors also exhibited
significant correlations (Second: r = 0.11, t(19) = 3.60, p = .002,
Cohen’s d = 0.81, 95 % CI for the mean = [0.045, 0.170]; Third: r =
0.07, t(19) = 2.43, p = .025, Cohen’s d = 0.54, 95 % CI for the mean =
[0.010, 0.129]), which were significantly smaller than those in Carte­
sian dimensions (Second: r = 0.19, t(19) = -7.82, p < .001, Cohen’s d =
-1.75, 95 % CI for the mean difference = [-0.236, − 0.136]; Third: r =
0.19, t(19) = -6.18, p < .001, Cohen’s d = -1.38, 95 % CI for the mean
difference = [-0.252, − 0.124]) (see Fig. 2).
These results indicate that, particularly in the first responses, par­
ticipants spontaneously adopted polar coordinates to represent spatial
information, consistent with previous findings (Yousif et al., 2024).
However, in the case of the last two responses, we still observed small
correlations in polar dimensions. This could be attributed to the incon­
sistent anchoring behavior exhibited by certain participants when
reproducing the positions of the second and third targets. They may
have employed the first responses as the anchor points in some trials,
deviating from the expected anchoring at the center point. Conse­
quently, the polar errors calculated based on the center point were
highly correlated for these participants, who were likely to be the out­
liers shown in Fig. 2. Nonetheless, the larger Cartesian correlations

Experiment 1 replicated previous findings that in tasks with minimal
intervening spatial structure, participants’ error patterns aligned more
with the use of polar coordinate representations. However, the critical
question remained: Is spatial format fixed, or does it adapt based on the
provided spatial layout and reference frame. To address this, in Exper­
iment 2, we drew inspirations from the manipulation employed in the
prior research (Yousif & Keil, 2021). Specifically, we structured the
memory context as a grid-like environment (Fig. 1A) that strongly
implied a Cartesian system, aiming to determine whether spatial rep­
resentations in WM would remain in polar coordinates under such a
context.
Methods
Another group of twenty volunteers (7 males and 13 females, aged
18–24) from Sun Yat-sen University participated in Experiment 2. The
sample size determination followed a similar approach to that of
Experiment 1. The whole task took approximately 50 min.
The procedures in Experiment 2 closely paralleled those in Experi­
ment 1, with a few key distinctions. Specifically, the memory contexts
during both the encoding and response phases were configured in a grid
pattern, contrasting Experiment 1′s utilization of blank memory
contexts.
Results & discussion
2.7 % of responses were removed due to reproduction errors
exceeding +/- 3 standard deviations (SD) from the mean error of each
participant. Across all responses, only the correlations in polar di­
mensions exhibited significance (First: 0.20, t(19) = 11.15, p < .001,
Cohen’s d = 2.49, 95 % CI for the mean = [0.165, 0.242]; Second: 0.15, t
(19) = 6.62, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.48, 95 % CI for the mean = [0.104,
0.200]; Third: 0.14, t(19) = 5.47, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.22, 95 % CI for
the mean = [0.088, 0.198]). In contrast, the correlations in Cartesian
dimensions were not statistically significant (First: 0.03, t(19) = 1.82, p
= .085, Cohen’s d = 0.41, 95 % CI for the mean = [-0.005, 0.070];
Second: 0.04, t(19) = 1.96, p = .065, Cohen’s d = 0.44, 95 % CI for the

0.15, t(19) = 4.97, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.11, 95 % CI for the mean =
[0.084, 0.207]; Third: 0.17, t(19) = 6.43, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.44, 95
% CI for the mean = [0.113, 0.223]); Polar: First: 0.08, t(19) = 2.91, p =
.009, Cohen’s d = 0.65, 95 % CI for the mean = [0.022, 0.136]; Second:
0.10, t(19) = 5.38, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.20, 95 % CI for the mean =
[0.063, 0.143]; Third: 0.07, t(19) = 2.62, p = .017, Cohen’s d = 0.59, 95
% CI for the mean = [0.013, 0.121]). In contrast to the results in
Experiment 1, the two correlations did not differ from each other
significantly in the first two responses (First: 0.03, t(19) = 0.95, p =
.355, Cohen’s d = 0.21, 95 % CI for the mean difference = [-0.037,
0.099]; Second: 0.04, t(19) = 1.43, p = .168, Cohen’s d = 0.32, 95 % CI
for the mean difference = [-0.019, 0.104]; Third: 0.10, t(19) = 3.36, p =
.003, Cohen’s d = 0.75, 95 % CI for the mean difference = [0.038,
0.164]) (Fig. 4).
The results indicate that the introduction of a grid-like context dur­
ing the encoding phase may potentially induce a change in the spatial
representation format adopted by participants, even though these results
neither align with the predictions of the Cartesian representations nor
the predictions of the polar representations.
A cross-experiment analysis between Experiments 1 and 3A: To
further confirm the effects of solely introducing grid-like memory con­
texts during the encoding phase, we selected the first responses as a
typical example and conducted a cross-experiment analysis comparing
Experiments 1 and 3A. The results revealed a significant interaction
between memory context and coordinate system (Interaction: F(1, 38) =
5.28, p = .027, ηp2 = 0.12; Context: F(1, 38) < 0.001, p = .991, ηp2 <
0.001; Coordinate system: F(1, 38) = 14.46, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.28),
indicating a degree of change in the representation format.
Experiment 3B: 1.4 % of responses were removed due to repro­
duction errors exceeding +/- 3 standard deviations (SD) from the mean
error of each participant. Similar to the results in Experiment 1, across
all responses, only Cartesian correlations exhibited significance (Carte­
sian: First: 0.16, t(19) = 4.50, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.01, 95 % CI for the
mean = [0.084, 0.231]; Second: 0.19, t(19) = 5.66, p < .001, Cohen’s d
= 1.27, 95 % CI for the mean = [0.121, 0.264]; Third: 0.18, t(19) = 5.41,
p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.21, 95 % CI for the mean = [0.109, 0.247]);
Polar: First: − 0.02, t(19) = -0.78, p = .448, Cohen’s d = 0.17, 95 % CI for
the mean = [-0.062, 0.028]; Second: 0.03, t(19) = 1.30, p = .208,
Cohen’s d = 0.29, 95 % CI for the mean = [-0.030, 0.084]; Third: 0.02, t
(19) = 1.01, p = .323, Cohen’s d = 0.23, 95 % CI for the mean = [-0.026,
0.074]). And the Cartesian correlations were significantly larger than
polar correlations (First: 0.18, t(19) = 5.26, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.18,
95 % CI for the mean difference = [0.105, 0.244]; Second: 0.16, t(19) =
4.82, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.08, 95 % CI for the mean difference =

mean = [-0.003, 0.090]; Third: 0.04, t(19) = 1.88, p = .076, Cohen’s d =
0.42, 95 % CI for the mean = [-0.005, 0.092]). The correlation values in
Cartesian dimensions were consistently and significantly smaller
compared to those observed in polar dimensions (First: − 0.17, t(19) =
-8.00, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.79, 95 % CI for the mean difference =
[-0.216, − 0.126]; Second: − 0.11, t(19) = -3.04, p = .007, Cohen’s d =
0.68, 95 % CI for the mean = [-0.183, − 0.034]; Third: − 0.10, t(19) =
-2.67, p = .015, Cohen’s d = 0.60, 95 % CI for the mean = [-0.178,
− 0.022]) (Fig. 3).
These findings provide evidence that participants tend to adopt a
Cartesian representation format in grid-like contexts, suggesting a flex­
ibility in their capacity to utilize distinct spatial representation formats
contingent upon the characteristics of the memory context.
Experiment 3: The decisive stage of transitions in spatial
representation format within small-scale WM
The results of Experiment 2 revealed the flexible nature of spatial
representations in WM. In Experiment 3, we aimed to pinpoint the
critical stage that determines whether participants adopt a polar or
Cartesian representation. To do this, Experiment 3 consisted of two subexperiments. In Experiment 3A, only the encoding phase featured a grid
pattern in the memory background, while in Experiment 3B, this pattern
was introduced solely during the response phase.
Methods
Two separate groups of twenty new volunteers from Sun Yat-sen
University participated in Experiment 3A (10 males and 10 females,
aged 18–24) and Experiment 3B (8 males and 12 females, aged 18–23)
respectively. The sample size determination followed a similar approach
to that of Experiment 1.
The experimental procedures were similar to Experiment 1, except
for that the memory contexts during either the encoding or response
phases were configured in a grid pattern. Each task took approximately
50 min.
Results & discussion
Experiment 3A: 1.6 % of responses were removed due to repro­
duction errors exceeding +/- 3 standard deviations (SD) from the mean
error of each participant. Both Cartesian errors and polar errors
exhibited reliable correlations (Cartesian: First: 0.11, t(19) = 3.50, p =

demonstrate that space is still represented in polar coordinates when
only the memory context during the response phase is configured as a
grid pattern.
A cross-experiment analysis between Experiments 1 and 3B:
Similarly, to further confirm the effects of solely introducing grid-like
memory contexts during the response phase, we selected the first re­
sponses as a typical example and conducted a cross-experiment analysis
comparing Experiments 1 and 3B. The results revealed an insignificant
interaction between memory context and coordinate system (Interac­
tion: F(1, 38) = 1.40, p = .243, ηp2 = 0.04; Context: F(1, 38) = 0.52, p =
.475, ηp2 = 0.013; Coordinate system: F(1, 38) = 52.05, p < .001, ηp2 =
0.58), indicating no change in the representation format.
Combined with the results in previous two sub-experiments, Exper­
iment 3 illustrates the constrained flexibility of spatial representations in
WM. Specifically, the dominance of a Cartesian coordinate system for
representing spatial information is only observed when both the
encoding and response phases are configured as a grid-like memory
context. Notably, the encoding phase appears to play a more crucial role
in determining the spatial representation format, whereas the response
phase seems to have little influence on the representation format.

investigate the representation format of spatial information in smallscale WM. In Experiment 4, we employed virtual reality (VR) technol­
ogy to further examine how space was represented in large-scale WM.
Results from previous experiments suggested that the use of polar co­
ordinates was context-dependent. In grid-like environments that sug­
gested a more Cartesian structure, error patterns aligned with Cartesian
coordinates. Therefore, in the current experiment, we also examined the
flexibility of spatial representation format in large-scale WM. To address
this, participants were required to complete a spatial localization task
similar to Experiment 1, but in a VR environment. Given the distortion of
grid structure experienced from a first-person perspective within the VR
environment, we subsequently employed an alternative manipulation
approach. Drawing inspirations from Yousif et al. (2024), we examined
the influence of two distinct response types in separate sub-experiments.
In Experiment 4A, participants were asked to directly navigate to the
target location during the response phase. In Experiment 4B, partici­
pants were required to navigate horizontally and then vertically (or vice
versa) to the target location during the response phase.
Methods
Participants. Two separate groups of twenty new volunteers from
Sun Yat-sen University participated in Experiment 4A (10 males and 10
females, aged 18–24) and Experiment 4B (8 males and 12 females, aged
18–23) respectively. All participants were right-handed and reported
normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. The sample size was
determined in the similar manner as Experiment 1.

interaction with virtual reality contents.
The VR environment employed in Experiment 4 consisted of a square
area enclosed by four walls (150 m × 150 m). In order to facilitate the
differentiation of directions, the north wall was colored red, while the
south wall was colored blue. And the center of the VR environment was
marked as a red circle. Notably, in Experiment 4B, the terrain within the
VR environment was gridded to assist participants in indirectly navi­
gating to the target locations (Fig. 5A). Target locations in each trial
were randomly generated within a range of 11.25 m to 63.75 m hori­
zontally and vertically from the central point.
Experimental design and procedure. The experimental procedure
is depicted in Fig. 5B. Prior to the start of each trial, participants’ po­
sitions were reset to the center of the current environment, corre­
sponding to the location of the central cross on the map, and their
orientations were reset to face northward. In each trial, a square map
composed of a central cross and a red circle as the memory target was
presented for 1000 ms. Participants were instructed to memorize the
position of the target. After a blank interval of 1000 ms, participants
were required to manipulate a joystick to move to the corresponding
location of the target within the current VR environment. The distinc­
tion between Experiments 4A and 4B lay in the participants’ movement
constraints: in Experiment 4A, participants had unrestricted movement,
whereas in Experiment 4B, the terrain within the VR environment was
gridded, and participants were directed to navigate along the grid lines.
The entire trajectories of participants in each trial were recorded.
Each participant completed a total of 192 trials, distributed
randomly across four blocks. Before formal trials, participants under­
went 10–15 practice trials to familiarize themselves with the procedure.
During these practice trials, a white cube would appear at the correct
target position in the VR environment during the response phase,
serving as a navigation aid—an element absent in the subsequent
normal trials. On average, each task session lasted approximately 60
min.
Data analysis. To unify the unit of distance between the map and the
VR environment, we first normalized the distances by dividing them by
the corresponding maximum possible values in each respective context
(map size/2 or terrain size/2). Other analyses followed the same pro­
cedures as those employed in previous experiments.

predictions of both hypothesized representation formats. However,
previous research (Yousif et al., 2024) demonstrated that the pattern of
results generated by polar representation was highly robust, with
correlated Cartesian errors and uncorrelated polar errors. Conversely,
the pattern of results produced by Cartesian representations depended
on specific task details. Actually, the results in Experiment 4B were
consistent with the simulation analysis of Cartesian representations
using the actual noise estimated from Experiment 4B. Specifically, this
analysis revealed insignificant correlations for both coordinate systems
(see supplementary results). However, caution should be taken when
interpreting these results. Nevertheless, we can at least conclude that the
manner of response affected the representation format of spatial infor­
mation in large-scale WM.
A cross-experiment analysis between Experiments 4A and 4B: To
further verify the flexibility of spatial information formats in large-scale
WM, we conducted a cross-experiment comparison between Experi­
ments 4A and 4B. The results revealed a significant interaction between
response type and coordinate system (Interaction: F(1, 38) = 6.93, p =
.012, ηp2 = 0.15; Response type: F(1, 38) = 7.59, p = .009, ηp2 = 0.17;
Coordinate system: F(1, 38) = 13.26, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.26), indicating
the presence of flexible utilization of spatial representation formats
which is dependent on the response type (Fig. 6).
In summary, the results in Experiment 4 indicate that akin to smallscale WM, space is also represented in polar coordinate system in largescale WM by default, despite involving transitions of spatial information
across different scales in WM. Moreover, the representation formats of
space in large-scale WM are flexible as well, which are notably influ­
enced by the specific response requirements.

Results & discussion
Experiment 4A: 1.6 % of responses were removed due to repro­
duction errors exceeding +/- 3 standard deviations (SD) from the mean
error of each participant or RT exceeding 15 s. By examining the entire
trajectories of participants, we found that all participants navigated to
the target position directly in all trials. Only Cartesian correlations were
significant (0.15; t(19) = 5.00, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.12, 95 % CI for
the mean = [0.090, 0.219]). In contrast, polar correlations were not
significant (− 0.01; t(19) = -0.38, p = .705, Cohen’s d = -0.09, 95 % CI
for the mean = [-0.061, 0.042]), which were smaller than Cartesian
correlations (− 0.16, t(19) = -3.77, p = .001, Cohen’s d = -0.84, 95 % CI
for the mean difference = [-0.254, − 0.073]) (Fig. 6).
These results demonstrate that, consistent with laboratory findings,
spatial information in large-scale environment is also represented in
polar coordinates by default within WM.
Experiment 4B: 3.9 % of responses were removed due to repro­
duction errors exceeding +/- 3 standard deviations (SD) from the mean
error of each participant or RT exceeding 15 s. The entire trajectories of
participants showed that as requested, participants indeed navigated to
the target position indirectly. Both Cartesian correlations and polar
correlations were insignificant (Cartesian: 0.02, t(19) = 0.84, p = .409,
Cohen’s d = 0.19, 95 % CI for the mean = [-0.032, 0.075]; Polar: − 0.01,
t(19) = -0.31, p = .759, Cohen’s d = 0.07, 95 % CI for the mean =
[-0.036, 0.027]). And these two correlations were not significantly
different (0.03, t(19) = 0.91, p = .375, Cohen’s d = 0.20, 95 % CI for the
mean difference = [-0.034, 0.087]). This pattern deviated from the

Discussion
By utilizing error correlation analysis, the current study uncovered
the WM format of spatial representations within both small and large
environments. In Experiments 1–3, participants were tasked with
reproducing previously memorized locations of three targets. The results
in Experiment 1 aligned with prior research (Yousif et al., 2024),
affirming that participants spontaneously employed polar coordinates to
represent space within WM in small-scale environments. These findings
also validated the error correlation analysis. Consistent with previous
research (Yousif & Keil, 2021), Experiment 2 revealed the utilization of a

Cartesian representation format in grid-like contexts, indicating the
flexible nature of spatial representations within WM. Furthermore,
when introducing a grid pattern solely in the encoding phase (Experi­
ment 3A), the results did not align with predictions of either Cartesian or
polar representations. Conversely, when grid-like contexts were intro­
duced solely during the response phase (Experiment 3B), spatial repre­
sentation remained predominantly in polar coordinates. These results
demonstrated that the changes in representation format were driven by
the combined influence of context modifications during both the
encoding phase and the response phase. Specifically, changes to the
context during the encoding phase alone elicit moderate modifications
to the format of spatial representations. In contrast, changes solely to the
response phase context have minimal impact on altering the represen­
tation format.
In Experiment 4, participants initially memorized the target’s posi­
tion on a map, and then navigate to the corresponding target position in
a VR environment. In unconstrained situations, polar representations
were employed by default (Experiment 4A). Conversely, when partici­
pants were constrained to navigate indirectly to the target position, they
adopted Cartesian coordinates to represent space (Experiment 4B).
Overall, these findings provide compelling evidence supporting the
prevalence of polar representations in WM for spatial information across
both small and large environments. Moreover, these polar representa­
tions exhibit considerable flexibility. Specifically, in laboratory settings
where both the encoding and response phases incorporate grid-like
memory backgrounds, or in large-scale environments where partici­
pants are required to indirectly reproduce locations, Cartesian repre­
sentations are employed.
Although numerous studies have explored WM representations, little
research has specifically addressed how spatial information is repre­
sented in WM. Typically, current investigations either conflate spatial
information with other visual stimuli or emphasize its unique role in
representing other features. In the classic debate over whether WM
stores independent or hierarchical representations, locations are treated
similarly to other features. Traditional theories assume that items are
stored independently in WM (Adam et al., 2017; Luck & Vogel, 1997;
Zhang & Luck, 2008). However, recent evidence challenges this notion.
For example, Brady and Alvarez (2011) found that participants’ memory
for the size of a circle was biased toward the average size of circles of the
same color. This led to the hierarchical encoding model, which posits
that WM operates on multi-tiered displays that integrate objects and
ensembles (Brady & Alvarez, 2011; Brady & Alvarez, 2015; Utochkin &
Brady, 2020). Since then, numerous studies have provided support for
the hierarchical representation theory by adopting various features like
orientation and color (Oh et al., 2019; Son & Chong, 2023; Son et al.,
2020). Similarly, researchers have also utilized locations as experi­
mental material solely to furnish additional evidence for this theory
(Brady & Tenenbaum, 2013; Lew & Vul, 2015).
In the ongoing debate about the basic unit of WM, spatial informa­
tion has been suggested to play a crucial role in representing other
features. The object-based theory posits that WM stores features as in­
tegrated objects, with non-spatial features automatically binding to
specific locations (Balaban & Luria, 2017; Kondo & Saiki, 2012; Luck &
Vogel, 1997). However, some findings challenge this theory. For
instance, some studies have reported a modest decline in accuracy when
additional features are included (Oberauer & Eichenberger, 2013;
Hardman & Cowan, 2015). This has led to an alternative theory sug­
gesting that features are the basic units of WM. In this framework, lo­
cations seem to hold a unique status as well. Researchers employing
surprise tests have found that recall accuracy for non-spatial features
drops to chance levels when they are task-irrelevant (Chen & Wyble,
2016; Wyble et al., 2019). In contrast, task-irrelevant locations can still
be robustly recalled (Chen & Wyble, 2015; Foster et al., 2017). The
recently proposed Boolean map theory further emphasizes the critical
role of spatial information, positing that WM represents spatial occu­
pancy as Boolean maps and all features within a single map can be

simultaneously processed (Huang, 2020).
In sum, our study enriches the theoretical understanding of WM by
focusing on the specific representation format of spatial information.
This contributes to a better understanding of how spatial information is
encoded and represented, thereby advancing theoretical models of WM.
Additionally, our research aids in creating training programs to improve
spatial information processing skills (e.g., navigation, map usage) and
provides a foundation for optimizing spatial information representation
in fields such as VR and human–computer interaction.
Our study contributes to the understanding of spatial information
representation within WM compared to Yousif et al. (2024) in two key
ways. Firstly, building upon their work, our study further explored the
flexibility of spatial representation formats and elucidated the deter­
mining stages that governed the utilization of divergent representation
formats. This deepens our understanding of the inherent nature of
spatial representation formats in WM. Specifically, how spatial infor­
mation is represented depends on task demands and which format is
more conducive to task completion within the given situation or task.
Secondly, our study extended beyond a laboratory computer setting to a
large-scale VR environment to investigate this issue, given the practical
significance of spatial representations. The results revealed that despite
involving transitions of spatial information across different scales, the
default representation remained in polar coordinates, while also
demonstrating flexible utilizations depending on task demands.
Besides, these findings are in line with previous studies on mis­
localizations, suggesting the prevalence of polar representations in
cognitive processes involving spatial information. For instance, Yousif
et al. (2020) demonstrated distinct sensitivities to deviations in the
angle dimension across different regions when participants judged
whether the positions of two dots within separate shapes were matched.
Conversely, no region-specific sensitivities were observed in the distance
dimension. These findings imply independent perceptual judgments of
spatial location within the polar coordinate system, highlighting the
utilization of polar representations in spatial perception. Similarly, ev­
idence for polar representations emerged in large-scale spatial naviga­
tion tasks (Chrastil & Warren, 2014; Ericson & Warren, 2020; Warren,
2019). Additionally, studies on motor actions have identified a reliance
on polar coordinates as well (Flanders et al., 1992; Gordon et al., 1994).
In contrast to previous studies, our work quantitatively demonstrated
polar representations of space within WM in both small and large con­
texts by analyzing error correlations across different dimensions.
Moreover, we presented an alternative hypothesis of polar representa­
tions, specifically Cartesian representations, and conducted a compari­
son between the two through this error correlation analysis.
Collectively, these findings suggest the general applicability of polar
coordinates in various spatial information processes domains.
Moreover, our study advances the understanding of how we repre­
sent spatial information within WM in the context of natural behavior.
Recently, with the increasing emphasis on ecological validity in exper­
iments, VR has been widely adopted to investigate visual search and
spatial navigation (e.g., Draschkow & Võ, 2016; Helbing et al., 2020;
Igloi et al., 2010; Kit et al., 2014; Warren et al., 2017). However, the use
of VR in studying WM has been limited (but see Draschkow et al., 2021;
Draschkow et al., 2022). In this study, we utilized VR technology to
simulate a real-life task that requires the utilization of WM spatial rep­
resentations. The results showed that in this immersive WM task, spatial
information is still represented in polar coordinates and is influenced by
the response type. Our study combines methodological rigor and
ecological validity, revealing the consistency of spatial WM represen­
tation formats between real-life and laboratory environments, as well as
the flexibility of cognitive systems in real-world settings. These findings
provide valuable insights for future endeavors aiming to incorporate
ecological elements into laboratory-based research.
Finally, the current study has several limitations, which holds im­
plications for future research. The first one regards the analytical
approach employed, which only considered two simple opposing
9

hypotheses − Cartesian representation and polar representation. How­
ever, these two hypotheses may not be mutually exclusive. As suggested
by Yousif (2022), spatial information may be simultaneously repre­
sented in multiple formats. Certain results obtained in this study that did
not align with the predictions of either Cartesian or polar coordinates
also implied this possibility. For example, in Experiment 1, significant
correlations were observed in both Cartesian and polar dimensions
during the second and third responses. To explore this aspect further,
future research could leverage more sensitive analysis methods or task
paradigms capable of investigating spatial information representation in
more complex scenarios.
Secondly, although our study revealed the flexibility of spatial rep­
resentation formats in WM, it focused solely on the effects of memory
context and response type. It remains unclear whether other factors
influence the conversion of representation formats and what funda­
mentally determines these transitions. Additionally, in large-scale en­
vironments, we observed that direct or indirect navigation to target
locations influenced the representation format of spatial information.
However, real-life situations often involve non-linear paths with multi­
ple turns. Further research is needed to examine if these findings hold
true in such cases.
Lastly, in light of previous research, the universality of polar repre­
sentations in various spatial information processes is suggested. How­
ever, the neural basis of this trait remains unclear. Numerous studies
have already identified neural cells that represent spatial information,
such as place cells that are sensitive to specific locations (Moser et al.,
2008; O’Keefe & Dostrovsky, 1971), head-direction cells that represent
an organism’s heading direction (Taube, 1998), and grid cells (Hafting
et al., 2005; Kraus et al., 2015) that represent multiple structured lo­
cations. Future research could explore which neural activities of these
cells determine the use of polar representation.
