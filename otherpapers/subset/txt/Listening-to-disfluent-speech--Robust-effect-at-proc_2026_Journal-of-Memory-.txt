Introduction
Fillers, or filled pauses, are a common disfluency type that exists
across languages in language-specific forms (Clark & Fox Tree, 2002).
English-speaking adults produce the fillers “uh” and “um” roughly once
per 100 words, though these statistics vary according to environmental
and speaker characteristics (Bortfeld et al., 2001). Importantly, fillers
are more likely to be produced ahead of low-frequency or otherwise
difficult-to-retrieve words (Beattie & Butterworth, 1979; de Jong, 2016),
and they are a reliable signal to upcoming delays in the speech stream
(Clark & Fox Tree, 2002). Adult listeners are able to harness these sta­
tistics to make predictions for “what comes next” in a disfluent utter­
ance, although the mechanism underlying this process remains under
debate and the downstream consequences for learning are poorly un­
derstood. According to the listener-oriented view, fillers are intention­
ally produced as a cue to upcoming difficulty (Clark and Fox Tree,
2002). Alternatively, the disfluency-novelty link may stem purely from
production demands (the speaker-oriented view, Corley & Stewart,
2008). The process underlying disfluency processing has critical impli­
cations for learning, as disfluencies and the assumptions people have
about them may make people less likely to trust and learn from a dis­
fluent speaker (White et al., 2020). In the present study, we rely on the

predictive processing hypothesis to examine adults’ expectations
following fillers and the consequences of fillers for novel word learning.
Processing fillers
There is robust evidence that listeners assign meaning to fillers and
use them to process language more efficiently (e.g., Arnold et al., 2007;
Arnold et al., 2004; Arnold et al., 2003; Corley et al., 2007; Kidd et al.,
2011; Collard et al., 2008; Morin-Lessard & Byers-Heinlein, 2019;
Owens & Graham, 2016; Watanabe et al., 2008; Karimi et al, 2019). In
one example of filler perception research, Arnold and colleagues (2007)
used eye tracking and gating tasks to assess listeners’ predictions
following fillers. Participants looked at a screen with novel and familiar
stimuli on either side and heard fluent or disfluent instructions to “click
on the/thee uh” object. In the eye-tracking task, participants heard the
full sentence and researchers analysed looks to target following the
fluent or disfluent determiner. They found a bias toward the novel object
upon hearing the disfluent determiner, but no such bias for fluent de­
terminers. On the gating task, participants only heard a portion of the
sentence: either “click on,” “click on the/thee uh,” or “click on the/thee
uh red.” None of the sentence fragments contained the target object, and
participants were asked to guess which object the speaker was referring

to. They found that participants were more likely to choose the unfa­
miliar object on disfluent trials and the familiar object on fluent trials,
consistent with the hypothesis that participants use disfluency as a cue
to upcoming novelty. Disfluent prosody (i.e., “click on” was longer and
higher pitch in the disfluent vs. fluent condition) was not sufficient to
guide predictions, rather, participants needed to hear the filler in order
to make reliable predictions.
Neurolinguistic work has also indicated effects of fillers on listeners,
in that fillers make unpredictable words less surprising to listeners.
Corley and colleagues (2007) measured adults’ Event-Related Potentials
(ERPs) during a listening task. One important ERP component in lan­
guage processing is the N400, in which voltages change as a result of the
demands associated with integrating semantic information. Corley and
colleagues told participants to listen to prerecorded snippets of
conversational speech for understanding, as they would in normal
conversation. Some of the stimuli ended predictably (e.g., “That drink’s
too hot; I’ve just burnt my tongue”), whereas others ended unpredict­
ably (e.g., “That drink’s too hot; I’ve just burnt my nails”). When the
stimuli were fluent, they found an N400 effect in the unpredictable
condition, indicating that the referent did, indeed, surprise listeners.
However, when the unpredictable word was preceded by a filler (e.g.,
“That drink’s too hot; I’ve just burnt my er nails”), this effect was
tempered.
Listeners’ expectations for disfluent speech appear malleable, and
expectations can be manipulated through speaker information (e.g.,
Arnold et al., 2007; Bosker et al., 2014; Bosker et al., 2019; Thacker
et al., 2018; Barr & Seyfeddinipur, 2010; Orena & White, 2015). For
example, Arnold and colleagues (2007) replicated their eye-tracking
task with additional speaker information, which provided cover stor­
ies for why the speaker might be disfluent in reference to easily acces­
sible referents. In one replication, participants were told that the speaker
had object agnosia, a condition that results in difficulty retrieving even
highly familiar words. In this manipulation, participants did not use
fillers predictively, suggesting that, in light of an alternative explanation
for disfluency, participants were able to limit their use of disfluency as a
cue to upcoming novelty. In another study, Bosker and colleagues
(2014) examined the impact of nonnative accent on listener predictions
following fillers. They used a similar paradigm to Arnold and colleagues,
except that their on-screen images were either high- or low-frequency
familiar objects. Like Arnold and colleagues, they found that partici­
pants adjusted their expectations for post-disfluency referents as a
function of speaker information: participants used disfluencies to
anticipate low-frequency referents in the native accent condition only.
Taken together, these findings indicate that listeners are highly sensitive
to the factors that influence disfluency and can adapt their predictions
according to available context.

boost memory in a variety of contexts.
Investigating the impact of disfluency on learning specifically,
Toftness and colleagues (2018) measured the consequences of dis­
fluency on college students’ learning by manipulating instructor dis­
fluency in pre-recorded mock lectures. In a between-subjects
manipulation, students watched lectures that were identical except in
delivery. Here, disfluency was conceptualized broadly, with the
instructor demonstrating a general lack of confidence and producing
numerous unfilled pauses. Regardless of testing schedule, performance
on the multiple-choice test was similar across conditions. Though it is
impossible to isolate the consequences of disfluent pauses for students’
performance from the other qualities of the disfluent instructor, Toftness
and colleagues (2018) provided early evidence for the role (or lack
thereof) of disfluency in learning.
The impact of disfluency on word learning remains unclear. To our
knowledge White and colleagues (2020) conducted the first study in this
area and Libersky and colleagues (2023) were the first to investigate this
question in adults. White and colleagues (2020) emphasized the impact
of disfluency on speaker credibility. In their first experiment, pre­
schoolers were introduced to fluent and disfluent puppets. The puppets
then labelled competing objects with the same novel label, and children
were asked to endorse one of the word-object pairs. Children were more
likely to endorse the pairing made by the fluent speaker. In their second
experiment, they tested the impact of disfluency on retention of novel
labels and found no effect. In a series of three experiments, Libersky and
colleagues (2023) taught monolingual and bilingual adults novel words
in a paired-associate learning task. Participants saw an illustration of a
single novel fish on a screen and heard its name in a fluent or a disfluent
sentence (e.g., “Thee [uh] gagek lives in warm streams in sunny areas”).
After all novel fish were presented, participants advanced immediately
to a three-alternative forced choice recognition task. Monolinguals
performed similarly across conditions in all three experiments. Bi­
linguals performed similarly across conditions when only novel fish
were presented but demonstrated better performance in the fluent
condition when the task was padded with trials featuring familiar fish,
indicating that learners with relatively less English-language experience
may benefit from fluency in certain contexts. An important limitation of
this prior study was that the design only allowed for measuring the effect
of disfluency on retention, rather than the cascading consequences of
disfluency at both processing and learning. That is, the impact of dis­
fluency on processing was inferred rather than observed. In the present
study, we address this gap by measuring the impact of disfluency on
processing and learning of novel words in the same individuals. Thus, we
first confirm whether or not learners used disfluency predictively during
processing and then ask whether disfluency has consequences for
learning.

Fillers, memory, and learning

Prediction error and word learning

Although the research on filler processing is extensive, literature
describing the impact of fillers on memory and learning is limited. In one
of the first studies of the impact of fillers on memory, Corley and col­
leagues (2007) measured memory for familiar target words embedded in
fluent and disfluent sentences. Adults remembered words presented
alongside disfluencies better than those presented in fluent sentences.
Other researchers have tested memory for familiar words following a
similar procedure, with mixed results. Diacheck and Brown-Schmidt
(2022) reported a memory boost for words presented in a disfluent
condition, whereas Bosker and colleagues (2014) reported no differ­
ences in recall. While these studies have focused on memory for specific
items, there is some evidence that disfluency may impact memory for
gist. Fraundorf and Watson (2011) had participants listen to and then
recall brief passages. The passages included 14 plot points, some of
which were presented disfluently. When asked to retell the passages
immediately after hearing them, participants demonstrated better recall
for disfluent plot points, reinforcing the possibility that disfluency may

Within the present study, we consider the impact of disfluency on
word learning through the prism of prediction error, considering the
possibility that predictive processing of fillers has cascading conse­
quences for word learning. The predictive processing hypothesis posits
that, in all areas of cognition, humans are constantly making and
updating predictions as they interact with the world around them (e.g.,
Clark, 2013; Schrimpf et al., 2021). Within the realm of language pro­
cessing, listeners rely on syntactic (Yano, 2018; Kamide et al., 2003),
semantic (Gambi et al., 2021; Kamide et al., 2003), and talker infor­
mation (Van Berkum et al., 2008; Borovsky & Creel, 2014) to anticipate
upcoming information. The literature on filler processing fits neatly into
this framework, as listeners harness fillers to anticipate upcoming ref­
erents, whether through statistical learning or through extracting
pragmatic information (Kidd et al., 2011; Clark & Fox Tree, 2002).
When given additional talker information (Arnold et al., 2007; Bosker
et al., 2014) or when listening to a speaker who produces disfluencies in
an atypical manner (Lowder et al., 2019), listeners update their

predictions and stop utilizing fillers as a cue to novelty.
Beyond its role in language processing, prior work has indicated a
strong role for prediction in word learning. Some studies tie correct
predictions (i.e., efficient processing) to language growth (Fernald &
Marchman, 2012), but there is also a rich literature linking prediction
error and learning. Within the prediction error framework, better
learning happens when the learner is surprised (Metcalfe, 2017), or, in a
more extreme view, learning only happens when a prediction error oc­
curs (Fitz & Chang, 2019). To test the prediction error mechanism in
word learning, Gambi and colleagues (2021) taught participants novel
words in high- or low-constraint contexts. These led to stronger or
weaker predictions of familiarity, respectively. Adults tested after a
5-minute delay learned best when strong predictions were disconfirmed,
but children did not show this effect. In another study with children,
Reuter and colleagues (2019) found that the children who learned best
were the ones who used a predict and redirect strategy at learning—i.e.,
they looked to the familiar object based on sentence structure then
redirected to the novel object upon hearing the novel label. Taken
together, these findings suggest that the ability to recover and learn from
prediction errors develops over time, but, when developed, is a powerful
learning mechanism.
Counterintuitively, within the context of fillers, a prediction error
effect would improve word retention under fluent conditions. Fillers
serve as a cue to novelty, and numerous processing studies have indi­
cated that listeners are able to harness this cue (Arnold et al., 2007;
Bosker et al., 2014). Consequently, listeners may expect a novel referent
following a filler and expect a familiar referent in the absence of a filler.
In a word learning task where both fluent and disfluent sentence con­
texts are present, learners are likely to make prediction errors in situa­
tions where they hear a fluent trial containing a novel word and predict a
familiar rather than a novel referent. It is on these trials that we would
expect listeners to be surprised when a novel referent is named within a
fluent sentence. Fluency would, thus, only impact learning when it
cooccurs with a prediction error.
We also investigate the time course of word learning by testing adults
either immediately or after a delay. Though memory traces decay
rapidly (Baddeley, 1975; Barrouillet et al., 2004; Barrouillet et al., 2007)
it is not always the case that word retention is worse after a delay. Some
learning contexts that are more difficult in the moment may yield slower
rates of decay—i.e., they serve as a desirable difficulty (Schmidt & Bjork,
1992). In the present study, we compare immediate performance with
performance after a six-minute delay and a 24-hour delay. The sixminute delay is consistent with the word learning paradigm used by
Gambi and colleagues (2021) that we adapted for the present study, as
well as that used by other researchers who work within the desirable
difficulties framework (e.g., Knabe et al., 2023) and has yielded effects
consistent with desirable difficulties when compared with performance
at immediate delay. The 24-hour delay was intended to make the delay
condition more demanding and to allow for novel words to be consoli­
dated into the lexicon (Davis et al., 2009; Gaskell & Dumay, 2003).

under the fluent condition may decay more slowly than memory
for words learned in the disfluent condition or even improve after
a delay.
The specific aim and design of each of the five experiments is sum­
marized in Table 1.

Participants
A total of 118 adults (66 immediate condition, 52 delay condition)
were included in the final sample. Our recruitment target was set to 70
participants (minimum of 50 after exclusions) per immediate and delay
condition and preregistered (see OSF Registrations tab, https://osf.
io/yj7pa/). This target was derived from Gambi and colleagues
(2021), as we adapted their paradigm and included a similar number of
parameters in our models. All participants gave informed consent
through a protocol approved by the UW-Madison Minimal Risk Research
IRB (protocol ID: 2013–0984, Effects of Bilingualism on Learning and
Memory). Our inclusionary criteria were preregistered and required that
participants were between ages 18–40 (inclusive), resided in the United
States, had no hearing impairments, were monolingual speakers of En­
glish (i.e., self-rated speaking proficiency less than “adequate” in any
languages besides English, as reported on the Language Experience and
Proficiency Questionnaire, LEAP-Q; Marian et al., 2007), and, for par­
ticipants in the delayed test condition, passed an attention check. The

Current study
In the present study, we investigated the impact of fillers on language
processing and word retention over different time scales (immediate,
six-minute delay, 24-hour delay) across five experiments. We had two
predictions:
(1) If participants are able to harness the statistics of fillers, they will
be more likely to predict a novel referent when a speaker is dis­
fluent than when a speaker is fluent.
(2) If fillers impact word retention via prediction error, recognition
of novel words will be better under fluent learning conditions,
assuming that disfluencies trigger prediction of novelty, and,
thus, the fluent context yields prediction errors. If prediction
error serves as a desirable difficulty, memory for words learned

attention check was included for participants in the delayed test con­
dition only in order to ensure that they were seated at their computer
watching the video that played during the delay. An additional four
participants were tested in the immediate test condition but were
excluded for reporting high proficiency in a language other than English
(a self-rated speaking proficiency of “adequate” or better, as reported on
the LEAP-Q; Marian et al., 2007). An additional 30 participants were
tested in the delayed test condition but excluded for reporting high
proficiency in a language other than English (n = 6), failing the attention
checks (n = 23), or both (n = 1). All participants were recruited via
Prolific (Prolific, 2014) prolific.co and tested remotely. See Table 2 for
participant characteristics.

uh/thee um,” and “[object]” in order to hear the full sentence. When
selecting an object, participants were instructed to “guess the final word
of [the] sentence.” Participants completed two training trials followed
by twelve exposure trials (six novel-disfluent, two novel-fluent, and four
familiar-fluent, described below). The procedure is described in Fig. 1.
The two training trials were both fluent; one ended with a novel
stimulus and one ended with a familiar stimulus. Participants were told
at the end of each training trial if their final selection was accurate. Of
the twelve exposure trials, eight ended in a novel label for the novel
image and four were filler trials and ended in a familiar label that
referred to the familiar object. The twelve trials were presented in a
random order. Novel words were all English-like, two-syllable words
selected from Gupta and colleagues (2004). They were associated with
novel objects selected from the Novel Object and Unusual Name (NOUN)
Database (Horst and Hout, 2016). Familiar objects and their labels were
all selected from the Bank of Standardized Stimuli (BOSS; Brodeur et al.,
2010), with the requirement that they had a two-syllable modal name.
Because familiar and novel objects appeared on the computer screen
side by side during exposure, we matched novel and familiar images on
visual complexity (proxied by JPG file size; Bates et al., 2003) using
Match (van Casteren & Davis, 2007).
All filler trials, on which the familiar object was referenced, were
presented in a fluent sentence frame, i.e., “Click on the [object].” In
contrast, novel objects were preceded by a disfluency (“thee uh” or “thee
um”) on six trials and presented in a fluent sentence frame on two trials.
We verified that novel stimuli in the fluent and disfluent conditions did
not meaningfully differ (see the Discussion for more on limitations of the
design). These ratios were adapted from Gambi and colleagues (2021)
and reflected the predictive nature of disfluencies in spontaneous
speech. As in spontaneous speech, disfluencies were a cue to upcoming
novelty. The most natural-sounding disfluencies were selected from a
larger pool of recordings based on consensus from lab members. Re­
cordings were spliced in Audacity (Audacity-Team, 2018) and normal­
ized to 70 dB in Praat (version 6.1.16; Boersma & Weenink, 2020). All
participants learned the same six objects in the disfluent condition, and
item effects were modelled in our analyses.

Procedure
Participants were tested remotely, via Gorilla Experiment Builder
(Anwyl-Irvine et al., 2020). Following consent, participants completed a
sound check (James, 2019) to ensure that auto-play was enabled for
auditory stimuli. To assess language experience and ability, participants
completed the LEAP-Q (Marian et al., 2007), and English language
proficiency was assessed using a speeded version of the Lexical Test for
Advanced Learners of English (LexTALE; Lemhöfer & Broersma, 2012;
Poort & Rodd, 2019). The LEAP-Q is a self-report measure of de­
mographics and language background, in which participants self-rate
their proficiency across their languages and describe when and how
they acquired the languages. The LEAP-Q has been shown to have good
internal validity and to align well to other (non-self-report) measures of
language proficiency (Marian et al., 2007). The LexTALE is a lexical
decision task designed to assess English-language knowledge quickly in
L2 English speakers and has also been used to assess L1 proficiency
(Dijkgraaf et al., 2017; Poort & Rodd, 2017). Participant characteristics,
including language background, are described in Table 2. Participants
completed study tasks in the following order: Consent, sound check,
LEAP-Q, experimental task, and LexTALE.
Materials

Test trials
Participants were tested on the eight novel objects in a field of four
recognition task. Participants heard the name of the novel object, from a
new female speaker of American English. The recordings at test were
from Gupta and colleagues’ (2004) database and thus assessed partici­
pants’ ability to generalize learning to a novel speaker. On each trial, the
target object was shown alongside three alternatives, and participants
clicked on the image that the speaker was referring to. The alternatives
were all novel words that participants had learned a label for, meaning
that familiar stimuli were not included at test. Participants were tested
on their recognition of each novel word three times, with position on the
screen and foils varying across trials. Test trials were pseudorandomized
such that the entire list was tested once before any words were tested a
second time, and each object was used as a foil six times. Feedback was
not provided at test. Words were tested multiple times to increase the
number of observations at test and to minimize the possibility that
participants were merely guessing the correct answer. Post-hoc analyses
indicated that performance improved with each subsequent testing
block, but testing cycle did not interact with any of the effects of interest.
Moreover, the pattern of results was the same when we reran our ana­
lyses on the first testing block only. Thus, we report the planned analyses
that included all three testing blocks.
The assignment to testing schedule (immediate vs. delayed) varied
between subjects and was randomized. Approximately half of the par­
ticipants advanced to the test trials immediately after the exposure
phase whereas the other half had a short break between exposure and
test trials. Participants in the delay condition watched a short cartoon
that had no spoken language (Mole as a Gardener; Miler, 1969) and then
responded to two comprehension questions. The comprehension

Exposure trials
The design of the exposure phase was adapted from Gambi and
colleagues (2021) and was the same for all participants. Participants saw
two objects on the computer screen, one familiar and one novel, and
heard a female native speaker of American English tell them to “Click on
| the | [object]” or “Click on | thee uh/um | [object].” The sentences
were broken up into three parts and presentation was self-paced, such
that participants had to select an object following “click on,” “the/thee

and.5). Upon hearing the determiner, participants were more likely to
select the novel object in the disfluent condition, M = 0.51, SD = 0.50,
than in the fluent condition, M = 0.39, SD = 0.49, B = 0.54, SE = 0.18,
X2(df = 1) = 9.03, p = .003.

Results
Data analysis
We analysed participants’ object selections on learning trials
following the fluent or disfluent determiner (intermediate-selections;
the second selection point) and following the full sentence (final-selec­
tions), as a function of fluency. We analysed their accuracy on retention
trials as a function of fluency, delay (immediate vs. six-minute delay),
and prediction accuracy (whether upon hearing the determiner they
incorrectly selected the familiar object or correctly selected the novel
object).
Item-level data were used in all analyses. Logistic mixed effects
models were used to analyse data in R (R Core Team, 2020) with the
LME4 package (Bates et al., 2015). Data were cleaned based on reaction
times (RTs); observations were excluded if RTs were below 150 ms,
above 5000 ms, or beyond 2.5SDs from the individual participants mean
RT. Based on these criteria, 313 observations were excluded from the
exposure data, across all selection points (out of 4956), and 177 obser­
vations were excluded from the recognition data (out of 2832). Maximal
random effects structures were retained except when the maximal model
had convergence or singularity issues (Barr et al., 2013), and the
buildmer package (Voeten, 2023) was used to identify the maximum
feasible random effects structure as necessary. Full model specifications
(including estimates for random effects) are available on OSF.

Retention
Overall, participants learned novel words to above chance levels (M
= 0.44, SD = 0.50, p < .001; chance = 0.25). To predict recognition task
accuracy, we regressed accuracy at testing on condition (fluent vs. dis­
fluent), delay (immediate vs. delay, coded as − .5 and.5), prediction
accuracy (prediction error vs. correct prediction, coded as − .5 and.5),
and all interactions. We observed a significant condition by delay
interaction, B = − 0.42, SE = 0.20, X2(df = 1) = 3.89, p = .048. Simple
effects indicated that participants in the immediate test group performed

.787, while participants in the delay test group performed better on
fluent items, B = − 0.31, SE = 0.29, X2(df = 1) = 0.07, p = .787. No other
variables were significant predictors of accuracy. Post-hoc analyses in
which we removed items that participants failed to map (i.e., items
where participants made an incorrect final selection at exposure) indi­
cated a significant group by condition interaction, B = -0.66, SE = 0.27,
X2(df = 1) = 4.70, p = .030. Again, simple effects indicated that par­
ticipants in the immediate test group performed better on disfluent
items, B = 0.22, SE = 0.34, X2(df = 1) = 0.019, p = .890, while par­
ticipants in the delay test group performed better on fluent items, B =
− 0.44, SE = 0.35, X2(df = 1) = 0.019, p = .890. No other variables were
significant predictors of accuracy.

Prediction of target at exposure
At exposure, participants’ final selections (selections upon hearing
the full object name) on filler familiar trials were highly accurate, M =
0.98, SD = 0.13. To predict selections on novel trials, we regressed

Experiment 2 participant characteristics.

We found that adult listeners were more likely to predict upcoming
novelty upon hearing a filler than upon hearing a fluent determiner,
consistent with prior findings (Arnold et al., 2007; Bosker et al., 2014;
Kidd et al., 2011). While analyses indicated different retention patterns
for disfluent and fluent items, and no impact of prediction error, we
hesitate to overinterpret these findings due to design limitations.
Specifically, our findings may reflect item effects. To assuage con­
cerns that the results of Experiment 1 were muddied by memorability of
the specific items across the fluent and the disfluent conditions, we ran
additional analyses comparing the novel items assigned to the fluent vs.
disfluent condition on several factors that could impact learning
including characteristics of the novel word (mean biphone probability of
the novel word), the novel object (visual complexity, familiarity,
nameability, colour saliency, texture saliency), and the familiar object
with which the novel object was paired (word frequency). These ana­
lyses yielded no significant differences between conditions, although we
acknowledge that these analyses are likely underpowered (see OSF for
these analyses). Moreover, because the same items were always assigned
to the same condition, the potential for item effects was high despite
careful matching of item characteristics across the conditions. To
address this design limitation, we conducted a second experiment in
which items were randomly assigned to condition on a participant-byparticipant basis.

trials to condition. Sentence frames were randomized such that any
novel item could be presented in either the disfluent or fluent condition.
Test trials
As in Experiment 1, recognition for each item was tested three times.
Each item was tested once before they were cycled through a second and
then third time.

Experiment 2
To address the possibility of item effects in Experiment 1, we con­
ducted a follow-up in which novel items were randomly assigned to the
disfluent or fluent condition. The design of the experiment was other­
wise the same, and participants met the same inclusionary criteria as in
Experiment 1.

Results
Data analysis
Our analytical approach was the same as in Experiment 1. Based on
RT criteria, 190 observations were excluded from the exposure data,
across all selection points (out of 4572), and 256 observations were
excluded from the recognition data (out of 3048). Full model specifi­
cations (including estimates for random effects) are available OSF.

Participants
A total of 127 adults (75 immediate condition, 52 delay condition)
were included in the final sample. As in Experiment 1, our recruitment
target was set to 70 participants (minimum of 50 after exclusions); some
people who reported technical issues opening the task were sent new
links, resulting in 75 participants in the immediate condition. All par­
ticipants gave informed consent through a protocol approved by the
UW-Madison Minimal Risk Research IRB (protocol ID: 2013–0984, Ef­
fects of Bilingualism on Learning and Memory). Our inclusionary
criteria were the same as in Experiment 1. An additional two partici­
pants were tested in the immediate test condition but excluded for
reporting high proficiency in a language other than English (n = 1) or
age outside of the targeted range (n = 1). An additional 42 participants
were tested in the delayed test condition but were excluded for reporting
high proficiency in a language other than English (n = 5), reporting a
history of hearing impairment (n = 1), failing the attention check (n =
34), failing the attention check and reporting high proficiency in a
second language (n = 1), or failing the attention check and reporting a
history of hearing impairment (n = 1). All participants were recruited
via Prolific (Prolific, 2014) and tested remotely. See Table 3 for partic­
ipant characteristics.

Prediction of target at exposure
At exposure, participants’ final selections (selections upon hearing
the full object name) on filler familiar trials were highly accurate, M =
0.99, SD = 0.09. To predict selections on novel trials, we regressed ac­
curacy on condition, fluent and disfluent, coded as − .5 and.5. Partici­
pants (correctly) selected the novel object across disfluent, M = 0.89, SD
= 0.31, and fluent, M = 0.83, SD = 0.38, conditions, but they were more
likely to select the correct object in the disfluent condition, B = 0.73, SE
= 0.24, X2(df = 1) = 9.10, p = .003.
Upon hearing the determiner, participants selected the familiar ob­
ject in filler trials at above chance levels, M = 0.76, SD = 0.43; p < .001.
To predict selections on novel trials, we regressed accuracy on condition
(fluent and disfluent, coded as − .5 and.5). Upon hearing the determiner,
participants were more likely to select the novel object in the disfluent
condition, M = 0.61, SD = 0.49, than in the fluent condition, M = 0.50,
SD = 0.50, B = 1.03, SE = 0.16, X2(df = 1) = 39.44, p < .001.
Retention
Overall, participants learned novel words to above chance levels (M
= 0.43, SD = 0.49, p < .001; chance = 0.25). To predict recognition task
accuracy, we regressed accuracy at testing on condition (fluent vs. dis­
fluent), delay (immediate vs. delay, coded as − .5 and.5), prediction
accuracy (prediction error vs. correct prediction, coded as − .5 and.5),
and all interactions. Condition, delay, prediction error and their in­
teractions were not significant predictors of accuracy. Post-hoc analyses
indicated a similar pattern of results after we removed items that par­
ticipants failed to map (i.e., items where participants made an incorrect
final selection at exposure; analyses included on OSF with other data and
scripts).

In Experiment 2, we randomly assigned items to fluent and disfluent
conditions, whereas in Experiment 1 the items were not randomly
assigned. The impact of disfluency on processing was consistent across
experiments: in both experiments, participants used disfluency to
anticipate the novel object. However, the impact of disfluency on
retention was different. In Experiment 1, we observed better retention in
the disfluent condition at immediate testing, and better retention in the
fluent condition in the delayed condition, although neither effect was
strong enough to yield simple effects. Here, we observed similar reten­
tion across conditions, for participants in both the immediate and
delayed test conditions. In both experiments, the effect of prediction
error on retention was not significant. In interpreting these results, we
considered the possibility that the absence of robust disfluency effects in
Experiments 1 and 2 was due to the relatively brief delay of six minutes.
In Experiment 3, we ran a partial replication of Experiments 1 and 2, in
which we increased the length of the testing delay from six-minutes to
24-hours.

or disfluent condition.

Experiment 3

Results

Although six-minutes should be sufficient to clear working memory
based on prior work (Angwin et al., 2019; Knabe et al., 2023), it did not
yield detectable differences in retention in Experiments 1 and 2. In
Experiment 3, we tested the impact of disfluency on word retention over
time by increasing the delay between teaching and testing to 24-hours.
Critically, this delay should allow time for participants to consolidate
novel words into their lexicons.

Data analysis
Our analytical approach was the same as in Experiment 1. Based on
RT criteria, 212 observations were excluded from the exposure data,
across all selection points (out of 4608), and 184 observations were
excluded from the recognition data (out of 3072). Full model specifi­
cations (including estimates for random effects) are available on OSF.
Prediction of target at exposure
At exposure, participants’ final selections (selections upon hearing
the full object name) on familiar filler trials were highly accurate, M =
0.99, SD = 0.11. To predict selections on novel trials, we regressed ac­
curacy on condition, fluent and disfluent, coded as − .5 and.5. Partici­
pants were more likely to select the novel object in the disfluent
condition, M = 0.88, SD = 0.32, than in the fluent, M = 0.83, SD = 0.38,
conditions, B = 0.56, SE = 0.23, X2(df = 1) = 5.70, p = .0.17.
Upon hearing the determiner, participants selected the familiar ob­
ject in filler trials at above chance levels, M = 0.65, SD = 0.48; p < .001.
To predict selections on novel trials, we regressed accuracy on condition
(fluent and disfluent, coded as − .5 and.5). Upon hearing the determiner,
participants were more likely to select the novel object in the disfluent
condition, M = 0.57, SD = 0.50, than in the fluent condition, M = 0.35,
SD = 0.48, B = 0.98, SE = 0.20, X2(df = 1) = 25.18, p < .001.

Participants
A total of 128 adults (68 immediate condition, 60 delay condition)
were included in the final sample. As before, our recruitment target was
set to 70 participants (minimum of 50 after exclusions). All participants
gave informed consent through a protocol approved by UW-Madison
Minimal Risk Research IRB (protocol ID: 2013–0984, Effects of Bilin­
gualism on Learning and Memory). Our inclusionary criteria were the
same as in previous experiments. Two additional participants in the
immediate test condition and three additional participants in the delay
condition were tested but excluded for reporting high proficiency in a
language other than English. An additional 18 participants were tested
in the delayed test condition but did not return on day two. All partic­
ipants were recruited via Prolific (Prolific, 2014) and tested remotely.
See Table 4 for participant characteristics.

Retention
Overall, participants learned novel words to above chance levels (M
= 0.40, SD = 0.49, p < .001; chance = 0.25). To predict recognition task
accuracy, we regressed accuracy at testing on condition (fluent vs. dis­
fluent), delay (immediate vs. delay, coded as − .5 and.5), prediction
accuracy (prediction error vs. correct prediction, coded as − .5 and.5),
and all interactions. Delay was the only significant predictor of accu­
racy, with participants in the 24hr delay condition performing worse
than participants in the immediate test condition, B = − 0.47, SE = 0.14,
X2(df = 1) = 12.22, p < .001. Post-hoc analyses indicated a similar
pattern of results after we removed items that participants failed to map
(i.e., items where participants made an incorrect final selection at
exposure; analyses included on OSF with other data and scripts).

Procedure
The procedure for the immediate test group was the same as in Ex­
periments 1 and 2, but the procedure for the delay group was modified
to include a longer delay. On day one, participants were recruited via
Prolific (Prolific, 2014) and made aware that the experiment would be
completed over two days. After consenting to participate, participants
completed the exposure phase only. On day two, participants were
tested for retention of the novel items before completing the LEAP-Q and
LexTALE. Participants were recruited during a two-hour window on day
one, and the task was reopened for a four-hour window on day two. The
middle of the day-two window was exactly 24-hours after the middle of
the day one window. On day two, participants were messaged when the
experiment reopened and before it closed. Participants were allowed to
participate after the day two window had closed if they messaged on the
same day.

Discussion
In Experiment 3, we increased the delay between teaching and
testing from six-minutes to 24-hours while otherwise replicating
Experiment 2. Again, we found that participants used disfluency to
anticipate the novel object. However, the delay—not the fluency con­
dition and not prediction error—was the only manipulation to impact

retention. Across the three experiments, the effect of disfluencies and
prediction error on retention was largely null, but one common design
feature across the experiments may have influenced this pattern. Spe­
cifically, the limited number of items in the fluent condition (n = 2) may
have contributed to the null results of disfluency and prediction error on
retention, since it is well known that low power increases the risk of
spurious findings (Ioannidis, 2005; Wacholder et al., 2004).To address
this limitation, we conducted a follow-up experiment in which both the
fluent and disfluent conditions featured four items.

In instances where participants reported fewer than 12 years of schooling but
also reported that they had finished high school, years of education was trans­
formed as follows: high school = 12 years, some college = 14 years, college or
some graduate school = 16 years (as the length of graduate school is variable),
and masters = 14 years.

To address the possibility the findings in Experiments 1–3 were due a
small number of items in the novel-fluent condition, we conducted
another partial replication. In Experiment 4, we increased the number of
novel-fluent trials and randomly assigned novel items to the fluent and
disfluent conditions on a participant-by-participant basis. This approach
yielded a larger sample of fluent items on which to base our conclusions
and minimized the possibility of item effects. The trade-off is that the
within-experiment association between disfluency and novelty is
weakened relative to Experiments 1–3. Consequently, any effect of dis­
fluency would be reflective of participants day-to-day experiences rather
than within-experiment experiences with disfluency.

Retention
Overall, participants learned novel words to above chance levels (M
= 0.40, SD = 0.49, p < .001; chance = 0.25). To predict recognition task
accuracy, we regressed accuracy at testing on condition (fluent vs. dis­
fluent), delay (immediate vs. delay, coded as − .5 and.5), prediction
accuracy (prediction error vs. correct prediction, coded as − .5 and.5),
and all interactions. Condition predicted accuracy, with participants
performing better in the fluent condition, B = -0.22, SE = 0.09, X2(df =
1) = 5.65, p = .017. We also observed a significant three-way interaction
among the three predictor variables – condition, delay, and prediction
accuracy, B = − 1.09, SE = 0.48, X2(df = 1) = 5.26, p = .021. To interpret
this interaction, we recentered the group and condition variables and
obtained the simple effects. Participants in the immediate test group
benefitted from prediction error only in the fluent condition, whereas
participants in the delay test condition benefitted from prediction error
only in the disfluent condition; see Fig. S2 for visualization and OSF for
simple effects. Post-hoc analyses after we removed items that partici­
pants failed to map (i.e., items where participants made an incorrect
final selection at exposure), also yielded a significant three-way inter­
action and a marginal condition effect, B = − 0.20, SE = 0.11, X2(df = 1)
= 3.60, p = .058; analyses included on OSF with other data and scripts.
Because the immediate and delay groups differed on age and gender, we
reran both models with age and gender as covariates. The model with all
observations yielded a significant effect of condition but the three-way
interaction became marginal; the model fitted on the filtered data set
yielded a significant effect of condition and a significant three-way
interaction. Because the pattern of findings was similar across ana­
lyses, we report the models without covariates, but the analyses con­
taining covariates are available on OSF.

Participants
A total of 121 adults (62 immediate condition, 58 delay condition)
were included in the final sample. As before, our recruitment target was
set to 70 participants (minimum of 50 after exclusions). All participants
gave informed consent through a protocol approved by the UW-Madison
Minimal Risk Research IRB (protocol ID: 2013–0984, Effects of Bilin­
gualism on Learning and Memory). Our inclusionary criteria were the
same as in prior experiments. One additional participant was tested in
the immediate test condition but excluded for reporting high proficiency
in a language other than English. An additional 33 participants were
tested in the delayed test condition but were excluded for reporting high
proficiency in a language other than English (n = 3) or failing the
attention checks (n = 30). All participants were recruited via Prolific
(Prolific, 2014) and tested remotely. See Table 5 for participant
characteristics.
Results
Data analysis
Our analytical approach was the same as in Experiment 1. Based on
RT criteria, 174 observations were excluded from the exposure data,
across all selection points (out of 4320), and 184 observations were
excluded from the recognition data (out of 2880). Full model specifi­
cations (including estimates for random effects) are available OSF.

Discussion
In Experiment 4, we addressed another limitation of the prior ex­
periments: the small number of items within the fluent novel condition.
In Experiments 1–3, we chose to have six items in the disfluent-novel
condition and two items in the fluent-novel condition based on a
study by Gambi and colleagues (2021). In this way, Experiments 1–3
presented disfluencies in an ecologically valid manner, since in spon­
taneous speech disfluencies are more likely to precede discourse-novel
information (Beattie & Butterworth, 1979; de Jong, 2016). Therefore,
in Experiments 1–3, the effect of disfluency (if observed) would have
been a reflection of both the statistics learned within the experiments
and the cumulative experience with disfluent language. Another issue
with Experiments 1–3 was the limited number of items in the fluentnovel condition, which could have made the effect of disfluency on
word retention unstable. In Experiment 4, we presented participants
with 4 items in both the fluent and the disfluent condition, increasing
power, and at the same time, eliminating the within-experiment

Prediction of target at exposure
At exposure, participants’ final selections (selections upon hearing
the full object name) on fluent filler trials were highly accurate, M =
0.99, SD = 0.11. To predict selections on novel trials, we regressed ac­
curacy on condition, fluent and disfluent, coded as − .5 and.5. Partici­
pants (correctly) selected the novel object at similar rates across
disfluent, M = 0.88, SD = 0.32, and fluent, M = 0.86, SD = 0.35, con­
ditions, B = 0.22, SE = 0.23, X2(df = 1) = 0.93, p = .33.
Upon hearing the determiner, participants selected the familiar ob­
ject in filler trials at above chance levels, M = 0.58, SD = 0.49; p < .001.
To predict selections on novel trials, we regressed accuracy on condition
(fluent and disfluent, coded as − .5 and.5). Upon hearing the determiner,
participants were more likely to select the novel object in the disfluent
condition, M = 0.53, SD = 0.50, than in the fluent condition, M = 0.39,

statistical distribution that would cue participants to the disfluency as
signalling novelty. Critically, in Experiment 4, we once again replicated
the effect of disfluency on processing, despite boosting the number of
fluent-novel items in the task. This suggests that participants were
making their predictions based on their cumulative experience with
disfluency rather than the relationship between disfluency and novelty
within the experiment itself. That said, the effect of disfluency on
retention was starkly different from those observed in Experiments 1–3.
Here, we found that participants performed better in the fluent condi­
tion, consistent with the literature on prediction error in word learning.
We also observed an interaction among condition, test delay, and pre­
diction error, such that the two-way interaction was different for the
immediate and delay groups. The immediate group benefitted from
prediction error in the fluent condition whereas the delay group
benefitted from prediction error in disfluent condition. In interpreting
this interaction, we exercise caution as the effect was weak, but it may
suggest a desirable difficulty wherein conditions that are challenging
during learning yield slower decay over time. To test whether this effect
would remain with a longer delay, we ran a final experiment that
replicated Experiment 4 while extending the delay from six-minutes to
24-hours.

Results

In Experiment 5, we tested the impact of disfluency on word learning
over time by including a 24-hour delay between teaching and testing. As
in Experiment 4, novel items were equally likely to occur in the fluent or
disfluent learning conditions.

Data analysis
Our analytical approach was the same as in Experiment 1. Based on
RT criteria, 230 observations were excluded from the exposure data,
across all selection points (out of 4716), and 212 observations were
excluded from the recognition data (out of 3144). Full model specifi­
cations (including estimates for random effects) are available on OSF.

Participants
A total of 131 adults (68 immediate condition, 63 delay condition)
were included in the final sample. As in Experiment 1, our recruitment
target was set to 70 participants (minimum of 50 after exclusions). All
participants gave informed consent through a protocol approved by the
UW-Madison Minimal Risk Research IRB (protocol ID: 2013–0984, Ef­
fects of Bilingualism on Learning and Memory). Our inclusionary
criteria were the same as in Experiment 1. An additional three partici­
pants were tested in the immediate test condition but excluded for
reporting high proficiency in a language other than English. An addi­
tional 21 participants were tested in the delayed test condition but did
not return on day two (n = 18) or were excluded for reporting high
proficiency in a language other than English (n = 1). All participants
were recruited via Prolific (Prolific, 2014) and tested remotely. See
Table 6 for participant characteristics.

Prediction of target at exposure
At exposure, participants’ final selections (selections upon hearing
the full object name) on fluent filler trials were highly accurate, M =
0.99, SD = 0.08. To predict selections on novel trials, we regressed ac­
curacy on condition, fluent and disfluent, coded as − .5 and.5. Partici­
pants (correctly) selected the novel object at similar rates across
disfluent, M = 0.87, SD = 0.33, and fluent, M = 0.88, SD = 0.33, con­
ditions, B = − 0.08, SE = 0.23, X2(df = 1) = 0.12, p = .732.
Upon hearing the determiner, participants selected the familiar ob­
ject in filler trials at above chance levels, M = 0.63, SD = 0.48, p < .001.
To predict selections on novel trials, we regressed accuracy on condition
(fluent and disfluent, coded as − .5 and.5). Random slopes were removed
due to convergence and singularity issues. Upon hearing the determiner,
participants were more likely to select the novel object in the disfluent
condition, M = 0.57, SD = 0.50, than in the fluent condition, M = 0.36,
SD = 0.48, B = 1.05, SE = 0.21, X2(df = 1) = 24.31, p < .001.

Procedure
The procedure for the immediate test group was the same as in prior
experiments, and the procedure for the delay group was the same as in
Experiment 3, which also included a 24-hour delay. On day one, par­
ticipants were recruited via Prolific (Prolific, 2014) and made aware that
the experiment would be completed over two days. After consenting to
participate, participants completed the exposure phase only. On day
two, participants were tested for retention of the novel items before
completing the LEAP-Q and LexTALE. Participants were recruited dur­
ing a two-hour window on day one, and the task was reopened for a fourhour window on day two. The middle of the day-two window was
exactly 24-hours after the middle of the day-one window. On day two,
participants were messaged when the experiment reopened and before it
closed. Participants were allowed to participate after the day two win­
dow had closed if they messaged on the same day.

Retention
Overall, participants learned novel words to above chance levels (M
= 0.40, SD = 0.49, p < .001; chance = 0.25). To predict recognition task
accuracy, we regressed accuracy at testing on condition (fluent vs. dis­
fluent), delay (immediate vs. delay, coded as − .5 and.5), prediction
accuracy (prediction error vs. correct prediction, coded as − .5 and.5),
and all interactions. Delay was a significant predictor of word retention,
B = -0.46, SE = 0.14, X2(df = 1) = 10.55, p = .001. Participants in the
immediate test condition performed better than participants in the 24hour delay test condition. Prediction accuracy was also a significant
predictor, B = -0.23, SE = 0.10, X2(df = 1) = 6.26p = .012: items where
participants made a prediction error were recognized more accurately at
test, independent of condition or delay. No other predictors were sig­
nificant. Post-hoc analyses indicated a similar pattern of results after we
removed items that participants failed to map (i.e., items where par­
ticipants made an incorrect final selection at exposure; analyses
included on OSF with other data and scripts).

dataset excluding items that participants failed to map at exposure. In
the full dataset, Bayes inclusion factors for condition ranged from 0.009
in Experiment 2 to 0.153 in Experiment 5. In the filtered dataset, Bayes
inclusion factors ranged from 0.008 (Experiment 4) to 0.966 (Experi­
ment 1). Thus, all inclusion factors fell below 1, indicating that the data
were more likely to occur under the null hypothesis (i.e., models without
condition). These results reinforce the conclusion from our frequentist
models, that disfluency does not impact word retention. See OSF for full
statistical output (“combined_bayes_followup.rmd”).

In our final experiment, participants received an equal number of
novel-disfluent, novel-fluent, and familiar-fluent trials at exposure. We
again found that participants used disfluency to anticipate upcoming
novelty, but this did not impact retention. As in Experiment 3, the delay
between teaching and testing impacted word retention, but the facili­
tative effect of fluency observed in Experiment 4 was not replicated in
Experiment 5. Unlike in Experiment 4, where prediction error exerted a
subtle effect on retention in tandem with condition and delay (i.e.,
participants in the immediate condition benefitted from prediction error
on fluent items and participants in the delay condition benefitted from
prediction error on disfluent items), in Experiment 5, prediction error
influenced retention more broadly, with prediction errors yielding bet­
ter retention independent of condition and delay.

General Discussion
The impact of fillers on word learning has received relatively little
attention in comparison to the impact of fillers on online processing, and
this study is one of the first to investigate the effects of fillers on learning.
Critically, there is a growing body of literature on the importance of
predictive processing, and the role of prediction error in word learning.
In the current work, we linked the occurrence of fillers to predictive
processing and examined whether prediction errors stemming from a
mismatch between disfluency and novelty (i.e., disfluency leads lis­
teners to predict novelty) would impact learning. We found that adult
listeners were more likely to predict upcoming novelty upon hearing a
filler than upon hearing a fluent determiner, consistent with prior
findings (Arnold et al., 2007; Kidd et al., 2011; Bosker et al., 2014).
Moreover, this effect persisted across five experiments, and was
observed even in Experiments 4 and 5, where an increase in the number
of items in the fluent-novel object condition resulted in a weaker asso­
ciation between disfluency and novelty than in Experiments 1––3.
Critically, although the impact of disfluency on processing was consis­
tently observed across all experiments, the impact of disfluency on
learning was inconsistent and largely null. Effects of prediction error
were also week and unstable: prediction error was involved in a threeway interaction in Experiment 4 and yielded a benefit for word reten­
tion in Experiment 5 but otherwise had no impact on retention. Effects of
delayed testing suggest that a longer delay posed more difficulty for
recall than a shorter delay, in line with theories emphasizing decay
(Baddeley, 1975; Barrouillet et al., 2004, 2007).

Post hoc analysis of disfluency on word retention
Across experiments, the impact of disfluency on retention was
largely null. Results are summarized in Table 7. To strengthen our
conclusions and to alleviate concerns that the negligible effect of dis­
fluency reflected low statistical power, we ran two sets of post hoc an­
alyses recommended by reviewers. First, we pooled data across
experiments (excluding Experiment 1, as items were not randomly
assigned to condition) and ran the same retention models reported for
individual experiments. As before, we regressed accuracy at testing on
condition (fluent vs. disfluent), delay (immediate vs. delay, coded as − .5
and.5), prediction error (correct prediction vs. prediction error) and all
interactions. Across 10,241 observations and 504 participants, there was
no effect of condition, B = 0.01, SE = 0.05, X2(df = 1) = 0.008, p = .977.
A similar pattern of results was observed when we removed items that
participants failed to map: across 8968 observations and 502 partici­
pants, there was no effect of condition (B = − 0.019, SE = 0.06, X2(df =
1) = 0.274, p = .601. Analyses are available on OSF.
We also reanalysed our retention data via Bayesian multilevel anal­
ysis. While frequentist analyses serve to “fail to reject the null hypoth­
esis,” Bayesian analyses enable us to estimate the amount of evidence for
null and alternative models. Bayesian mixed effects models were used to
analyse data in R (R Core Team, 2020) with the brms package (Bürkner,
2017). We derived Bayes inclusion factors for the condition effect. In­
clusion factors above 1 indicate that data are more likely to occur under
the alternative hypothesis (i.e., models with the predictor) and inclusion
factors below 1 indicate that data are more likely under the null hy­
pothesis. Again, we included the full dataset as well as the filtered

Processing
During the processing task, we found that adults were more likely to
select the novel object following a disfluent “thee uh/um” than after a
fluent “the.” However, even at the final selection point, after partici­
pants had heard the novel word, selection of the novel object was not at

ceiling. This seems to reflect a bias to choose the familiar object, as
participants were more likely to choose the familiar object even at the
first selection point (when all they had heard was “click on”). Thus, we
conclude that the presence of a filler makes adults significantly more
likely to predict a novel referent, although a familiar object bias persists.
Our findings—in tandem with recent web-based disfluency research by
Karimi and colleagues (2019) and Diachek and Brown-Schmidt
(2022)—demonstrate that effects of disfluency are observable even
under remote testing conditions that are relatively less sensitive than the
in-lab eye-tracking and EEG methodologies used in earlier studies.
Because the sentences are segmented, the task is somewhat less natu­
ralistic than tasks that present sentences in full. Here, participants are
forced to make a selection at two points in the sentence, which may not
reflect the type of prediction making that adults do when listening to a
sentence without interruptions. That said, because the self-paced nature
of our task limits the typically present disfluent prosody that accom­
panies fillers (Soderstrom & Morgan, 2007) and the length of the
segment with the determiner was identical across conditions (i.e., par­
ticipants were not simply responding to a delay), the present study also
strongly points to filler form as the nexus of this effect—although further
research will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.

on perception of speakers is alleviated, processing effects might cascade
to learning. Another point is that testing word retention via recognition
may not be the most sensitive approach to understanding the impact of
fluency on learning; future work could assess free recall of novel words
or competition with known words (i.e., consolidation) in order to build a
fuller picture of disfluent word learning.
Furthermore, learning studies are necessarily less well powered than
processing studies. In one-shot learning tasks like ours, participants can
only be taught so many items before retention dips below chance.
Compounding this, assuming any effect of disfluency on learning has a
smaller effect size than the effect of disfluency on processing, the
number of necessary items to observe an effect is actually higher than the
items needed to observe an effect on processing. In practice, studies of
disfluency on processing have had a greater number of items (Arnold
et al., 2007; Morin-Lessard & Byers-Heinlein, 2019) than studies of
disfluency on learning (Libersky et al., 2023; White et al., 2020).
Because underpowered studies may yield spurious findings (Ioannidis,
2005; Wacholder et al., 2004), it is not entirely surprising that the effect
of disfluency on learning does not replicate, either across studies or
within a single set of studies like ours. Westfall and colleagues (2014)
provide some guidance on power in situations where the number of
items is limited by what participants can feasibly respond to (i.e., more
participants are required), but the number of participants required for
studies with a limited number of items is not feasible in many cases. For
example, Brysbaert and Stevens (2018; within the context of reaction
time experiments) recommend 1,600 observations per condition
through some combination of participants and items (e.g., 40 partici­
pants each respond to 40 items per condition). Applying this guideline to
a learning task in which participants can only feasibly learn ten words
per condition, 160 participants would be required per condition. That
said, post hoc frequentist analyses pooling data across Experiments 2–5
(yielding 10,241 observations in the full dataset and 8968 observations
in the dataset filtered of incorrect mappings) indicated a null effect of
condition (fluent vs. disfluent) on retention, as did post hoc Bayesian
analyses of each experiment. However, the omnibus analyses only
partially address concerns about power. Although the number of par­
ticipants is increased, the number of stimuli remains a limiting factor.
Per Westfall and colleagues (2014), a counterbalanced design with 60
participants and 8 stimuli has 0.80 power to detect a minimum effect
size of 0.79; increasing the number of participants to 500 while retaining
the same number of items only lowers the minimum effect size to 0.76.
This is a common problem in word learning research, as presenting too
many items would result in below-chance retention. Therefore, although
post-hoc findings substantiate our original results, they were unplanned
and conducted at the recommendation of reviewers and do not address
limits on the number of items presented.
Previously, researchers have investigated the role of disfluency on
memory for gist information or events (e.g., what happened in a story,
Fraundorf & Watson, 2011; which familiar words appeared in a list,
Corley et al., 2007; what was taught in a lecture, Toftness et al., 2018)
and have typically shown either a disfluency advantage or no effect. This
contrasts with the direction of the effect observed here, perhaps due to
the role of speaker credibility in learning or the nature of novel word
learning. Prior work has indicated that listeners associate disfluencies
with lack of topic knowledge (Brennan & Williams, 1995), and people
prefer to learn from fluent instructors (Toftness et al., 2018; White et al.,
2020). Consequently, learners may deprioritize items that are preceded
by disfluency (with the caveat that work on disfluency and credibility
has used between- rather than within-speaker manipulations). More­
over, word learning is a unique memory task in that it involves encoding
a unique, precise phonological sequence and mapping it to a referent.
Prior work has indicated that memory for gist (e.g., what happened in a
story) is better retained than memory for items (Zeng et al., 2021); in the
case of item memory, familiar items (i.e., homophones, Storkel &
Maekawa, 2005, or words made up of familiar sounds or characters,
Reder et al., 2016) are learned better than unfamiliar items. Given the

Learning
Although the findings regarding processing were consistent across
experiments, the impact of disfluency and prediction error on word
retention was weak or null. In Experiment 1, we found that participants
in the immediate and delay groups were impacted by fluency differently,
with participants tested immediately demonstrating better performance
on fluent items and participants tested after a delay showing better
performance on disfluent items. In Experiment 4, participants performed
better in the fluent condition independent of which group they were in;
but we also observed a complex three-way interaction, where the impact
of fluency and prediction error differed across immediate (benefit of
prediction error on fluent items) and delayed (benefit of prediction error
on disfluent items) test conditions. In Experiment 5, we found that
learners benefitted from prediction error independent of fluency con­
dition or group. Given the inconsistency of these findings and the null
effect of disfluency on word retention in our post-hoc analyses, we are
inclined to view these results as a failure to replicate rather than
meaningful differences that can be interpreted.
Why might effects of disfluency on learning fail to replicate while
effects on processing are so consistent? For one, processing effects seem
to be much more robust. Numerous studies have found that adults and
children use disfluencies to anticipate upcoming referents, and this has
held across a variety of paradigms (e.g., visual world eye tracking tasks:
Arnold et al., 2007, EEG tasks: Corley et al., 2007, remote behavioural
tasks: Karimi et al., 2019; Diachek and Brown-Schmidt, 2022). In
contrast, the impact of disfluency on learning and memory remains
poorly understood and inconsistent. Some studies have found a dis­
fluency advantage (Corley et al., 2007; Diachek & Brown-Schmidt,
2022; Fraundorf & Watson, 2011), others have found a fluency advan­
tage (Libersky et al., 2023), and others have found no difference (Bosker
et al., 2014; Toftness et al., 2018). Notably, Libersky and colleagues
(2023) found a fluency advantage for bilinguals only, whereas mono­
linguals showed similar performance across conditions. This suggests
that the impact of disfluency may depend on prior language experience
(i.e., learners with sufficient exposure to the target language learn
similarly well from disfluent and fluent input, although what constitutes
sufficient exposure remains to be explored). Additionally, there are
competing processes at play when learning from disfluent speakers.
Although disfluency may orient learners to upcoming novelty, disfluent
speakers are considered less credible (Toftness et al., 2018). Future work
might unpack how much speaker knowledge is necessary for learners to
view a disfluent speaker as a qualified instructor and enable learners to
effectively use disfluency as a cue to novelty; if the impact of disfluency

relative difficulty of novel word learning (vs. prior tasks used in dis­
fluency research), it is possible that adults treat disfluency differently
during novel word learning vs. other processing and memory tasks,
leading to a different pattern of results.
Regarding retention over time, performance in the 24-hour delay
was worse than performance measured immediately. Reduced perfor­
mance after a delay over 12 h has been shown in many word learning
studies (e.g., Kaushanskaya, 2012; Schneider et al., 2002). However,
brief delays have also been shown to impact word retention (Angwin
et al., 2019; Knabe et al., 2023) as they should capture the initial transfer
of items from short- to long-term memory (Tehan & Tolan, 2007). Yet, in
our study, we did not observe reduced performance after the six-minute
delay. Instead, we observed an interaction between condition and delay
in one experiment (Experiment 1) and only after filtering out the items
that participants failed to map at exposure. The 24-hour delay is qual­
itatively different from the six-minute delay in that it involves sleep, and
new words are consolidated into the lexicon during sleep (Davis et al.,
2009; Gaskell & Dumay, 2003). Although we did not specifically query if
and how long participants slept in the 24-hour window between ses­
sions, and this would need to be addressed in any follow up studies.
Future work could explore the consequences of disfluency for consoli­
dation of novel words and integration into the lexicon via longer delays
(e.g., one-week) between exposure and testing (see Gaskell & Dumay,
2003), although our preliminary findings suggest a minimal impact of
disfluency on long-term retention.
