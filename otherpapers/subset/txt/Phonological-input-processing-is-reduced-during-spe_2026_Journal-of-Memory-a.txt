Introduction
One of the central traits of human communicative interaction is turn
taking — the rapid exchange of turns at talk between interlocutors, who
repeatedly switch roles of being listener and speaker (Sacks, Schegloff,
& Jefferson, 1974). While both comprehending and producing speech
are cognitively highly complex processes (e.g., Gambi & Pickering,
2017; Hagoort, 2019; Pickering & Garrod, 2004), they are frequently
executed simultaneously in conversational contexts (Barthel, Meyer, &
Levinson, 2017; Bögels, 2020; Pickering & Garrod, 2013).
Comprehenders are known to process incoming turns incrementally (Altmann & Kamide, 1999; Kamide, Altmann, & Haywood, 2003;
Tanenhaus, Magnuson, Dahan, & Chambers, 2000), building anticipations about the upcoming message and its relation to the unfolding
discourse (Barthel, Tomasello, & Liu, 2024; Gisladottir, Bögels, & Levinson, 2018; Heilbron, Armeni, Schoffelen, Hagoort, & de Lange, 2022;
Huettig, 2015; Ryskin & Nieuwland, 2023). These anticipations, in turn,
are frequently used to start planning a relevant next turn already in
overlap with the incoming turn (Barthel, 2020; Barthel & Rühlemann,
2025; Bögels, Magyari, & Levinson, 2015; Corps, Crossley, Gambi, &

Pickering, 2018). Interlocutors commonly overlap these related processes of comprehension and production presumably for a combination
of two reasons: First, planning complex turns takes a considerable
amount of time. Even planning to produce a single noun takes about
600 ms (Indefrey, 2011; Strijkers & Costa, 2011), and planning a
full sentence can take about one and a half seconds (Griffin & Bock,
2000; Sauppe, 2017; Schnur, Costa, & Caramazza, 2006). Second,
interlocutors treat the timing of speaking turns as being meaningful.
If, for instance, a request or an offer are not responded to within a
short amount of time, the request might be down-scaled or the offer
reformulated in a way to display the expectation of a non-preferred
response, like a rejection or a denial (Davidson, 1984; Pomeranz,
Atkinson, & Heritage, 1984; Pomeranz & Heritage, 2012). Even in less
extreme cases, in which the first speaker (who put forth the request
or offer) does not re-select for another turn after some time without
getting a response, a markedly long delay before the response would
still be interpreted to be meaningful. Even if the request is granted or
the offer accepted, a long gap before the response can be interpreted to
signal low willingness of the second speaker or to be relevant in some

other meaningful way (Blohm & Barthel, 2025; Henetz, 2017; Roberts,
Francis, & Morgan, 2006; Roberts, Margutti, & Takano, 2011). For
these reasons, taking turns in conversation regularly proceeds fast and
interlocutors are motivated to produce their turns quickly as soon as
the floor is open, which puts their language production processes under
considerable time pressure during conversation (Levinson & Torreira,
2015; Roberts & Levinson, 2017).
Speech planning has been shown to be cognitively demanding in
unscripted conversational contexts (Barthel & Rühlemann, 2025; Rühlemann & Barthel, 2024). Particularly when executed in overlap with
the incoming turn, speech planning has been found to both lead to
increased processing load and to take longer than when executed
in silence between turns (Barthel & Sauppe, 2019; Barthel, Sauppe,
Levinson, & Meyer, 2016). The most probable cause for the reduced
efficiency of speech planning processes during speech comprehension
has been proposed to be interference of the two processes (Fargier
& Laganaro, 2016; He, Meyer, & Brehm, 2021; Levelt, Roelofs, &
Meyer, 1999; Roelofs, 2021). One main strand of evidence for interference between comprehension and production comes from pictureword-interference experiments (e.g., Bürki, Elbuy, Madec, & Vasishth,
2020; Schriefers, Meyer, & Levelt, 1990; Wilshire, Singh, & Tattersall,
2016), where the presentation of a word (visual or auditory) can
decrease participants’ speed and accuracy in a picture-naming task.
The candidate explanation for the observed interference effects is that
speech production and comprehension compete for the same cognitive
resources and are run on partly overlapping neural infrastructure and
mental representations (Hagoort & Indefrey, 2014; Menenti, Gierhan,
Segaert, & Hagoort, 2011; Segaert, Menenti, Weber, Petersson, & Hagoort, 2012; Silbert, Honey, Simony, Poeppel, & Hasson, 2014). This
overlap in processes is particularly relevant in turn taking situations,
where both comprehension and production are under time pressure and
might compete for processing capacities within the ‘crunch zone’ in the
vicinity of turn transitions, where one speaker’s turn comes to an end
and the next speaker’s turn should start within a short gap, often as
short as 200 ms (Levinson & Torreira, 2015; Stivers et al., 2009).
Given that speech planning in overlap with the incoming turn is
a common strategy in conversational situations, and given that the
processes of planning and comprehension regularly interfere with each
other, two hypotheses are conceivable about the processes of comprehension in overlap with speech planning: Either comprehension is
prioritised over planning at times of resource competition, which we
will call the comprehension-prioritised hypothesis, or planning is prioritised over comprehension, which we will call the planning-prioritised
hypothesis.
Both hypotheses can be argued for a-priori from a goal-oriented
processing point of view: Favouring the comprehension-prioritised hypothesis, the primary task in dialogue situations may reasonably be
argued to be accurate comprehension, since perceived auditory information can only be held in working memory for a very limited amount
of time (e.g., Baddeley, 2003; Christiansen & Chater, 2016). Because
the rate and timing of information contained in the incoming turn is
not under the comprehender’s control, this information needs to be
processed as soon as it is encountered and translated into more abstract
representations that can be kept in memory more permanently and
used to update the comprehender’s discourse model of the ongoing
conversation. As a consequence, comprehension of the incoming turn
cannot be delayed and should thus take priority over speech planning,
lest the input remains unprocessed until its phonological traces fade,
which would jeopardise conversational success. Hence, in cases of
limited processing capacity, speech planning processes would need to
be deferred in favour of comprehension processes.
Alternatively, favouring the planning-prioritised hypothesis, the primary task in dialogue situations may reasonably be argued to be speech
planning, since early planning serves the goal of producing a turn
in tight coordination with the point of completion of the incoming
turn. Producing a turn at talk without a marked delay is frequently

essential to communicate the intended message and to avoid being
misinterpreted (Blohm & Barthel, 2025; Kendrick & Torreira, 2014;
Roberts & Francis, 2013). In moments of high processing load during
dialogue, speech planning would therefore have to be prioritised over
comprehension. In such cases, the planning of a relevant next turn
needs to be partly based on the anticipated message of the incoming
turn (Levinson & Torreira, 2015). While prioritising planning, next
speakers would have to rely mainly on previously generated anticipations of the input would and thus risk comprehension accuracy in
moments when the input is monitored only shallowly for the sake
of effective speech planning (e.g., Ferreira, Bailey, & Ferraro, 2002;
Ferreira & Patson, 2007).
While the planning-prioritised hypothesis and the comprehensionprioritised hypothesis represent extreme positions on a continuum and
interlocutors might adjust their processing strategies depending on
the conversational context, these opposing hypotheses make distinct
testable predictions about interlocutors’ language comprehension performance in dialogue situations that feature parallel comprehension
and planning: According to the comprehension-prioritised hypothesis,
planning should only be pursued in overlap with the incoming turn if
resources are permitting, so that comprehension should not suffer from
parallel planning. According to the planning-prioritised hypothesis, in
contrast, comprehension accuracy should be reduced in situations of
resource scarcity, so that a timely production of the next turn is not
compromised by input comprehension processes. In either case, one
process would be momentarily prioritised at the cost of another in moments of high processing load, since the two processes are competing
for processing resources and potentially interfere with one another.
The sources of these observed interferences can be located on
(a combination of) any linguistic processing level(s), ranging from
phonetic analysis/assembly to semantic and discourse representations.
Hence, the two opposing hypotheses, prioritising either planning or
comprehension, can be tested on different levels of linguistic processing. Testing a verbal question response task with quiz questions
that contained semantic illusions, Barthel (2021) showed that comprehension accuracy is reduced on the semantic level during concurrent
speech planning. Participants in that study accepted semantic illusions
like ‘‘What animal ate Little Red Riding Hood | when she visited
her aunt?’’1 (early planning condition) more often than illusions like
‘‘When Little Red Riding Hood visited her aunt, what animal ate
her |?’’ (late planning condition).2 In the early planning condition,
participants already engaged in planning their response at the point
in time when they encountered the illusion, making the illusion go
undetected significantly more often than in the late-planning condition,
where participants did not yet engage in response planning when they
encountered the illusion. These results suggest that semantic input
processing during parallel speech planning can be more shallow than
in the absence of speech planning, supporting the planning-prioritised
hypothesis.
Investigating related research questions using EEG in a go/no-go
picture naming task with sentence primes, Hustá, Nieuwland, and
Meyer (2023) tested N400 effects, which are related to semantic input
processing, when participants listened to a sentence containing an
expected versus unexpected final word and additionally overtly named
a picture that was presented either while hearing the final word or
two seconds later. Hustá et al. (2023) found the N400 to be more
negative in unexpected words than in expected words. In line with
the results by Barthel (2021), the authors found this N400 effect to be
attenuated when participants were planning their response in overlap
with being presented with the sentence final word, indicating that

semantic processing of the target word was reduced during concurrent
planning. Interestingly, in trials in which the picture was presented
in overlap with the target word, the authors also found evidence for
an increased N400 component in unexpected as compared to expected
words when subjects did not have to overtly name the picture. When
the picture showed an object from the no-go category (either fruit or
vegetable, depending on the experimental list), subjects did not have to
go through with naming the picture but instead had to press a button
to skip the naming. These no-go trials showed a comparable, while
reduced, effect of predictability of the sentence final word, suggesting
that not the processes of phonological or articulatory planning but
rather processes of conceptual preparation are the main source location
of the observable interference of speech planning with comprehension.
Nonetheless, these results do not exclude the possibility of additional
interference on lower processing levels, since the picture categorisation
task will probably have led to phonological processing of the picture
name (Bles & Jansma, 2008; Meyer & Damian, 2007; Navarrete & Costa,
2005). Moreover, the sentence comprehension and picture naming
tasks were unrelated to each other, calling for an investigation using a
more ecologically valid test that contains a speech planning task which
is designed to be conditionally relevant to the just comprehended input.
While language comprehension has been found to be more shallow
on the level of semantic processing during intervals of parallel speech
planning, it is unknown whether these effects can already be observed
on lower levels of abstraction. Since the speech planning process in
overlap with comprehension of the incoming turn is pursued at least until the phonological level (Barthel & Levinson, 2020), it is conceivable
that comprehension accuracy in overlap with speech planning suffers
already at the rather early stage of phonological processing. To pursue
this question, the present study tests participants’ phoneme detection accuracy in question-response sequences, comparing participants’
phoneme detection performance during intervals of speech comprehension in isolation on the one hand with intervals of comprehension in
overlap with response planning on the other hand. If phonological input
processing deteriorates during concurrent speech planning, phoneme
monitoring performance should be observed to be worse than in situations without concurrent planning. If, however, input comprehension is
prioritised during phases of processing resource scarcity, phoneme detection performance should not significantly differ between situations
of parallel planning on the one hand and comprehension in absence of
planning on the other hand.
To evaluate these hypotheses, participants’ phoneme detection performance was tested in three Experiments 1a, 1b, and 1c. In Experiment
1a, participants performed a dual task in which they heard a question
that they had to verbally respond to and at the same time monitor
for a target phoneme. Firstly, if next speakers start planning their
responses in overlap with the incoming turn, if possible, participants’
verbal response latencies should be shorter in early planning questions
than in late planning questions, as has been shown before (e.g. Barthel
& Levinson, 2020; Bögels, 2020). Secondly, if planning is prioritised
during phases of concurrent planning and comprehension, phoneme
detection performance should be worse and probably also slower when
the target phoneme is presented while participants are concurrently
planning their response as compared to while they are not concurrently
planning. If, however, comprehension is prioritised in these situations,
phoneme detection performance should be unimpaired by concurrent
planning. In Experiment 1b, participants performed the same phoneme
monitoring task but without having to verbally respond to the questions. Since participants do not engage in verbal response planning
in this Experiment, the type of question should not affect phoneme
detection performance or speed (unless there is an inherent difference
in difficulty to detect a target phoneme at different positions in the
question). In Experiment 1c, participants were given a speech planning
task that they had to do subsequent to the phoneme monitoring task.
While participants are engaged in speech planning in this Experiment,
phases of speech planning do never overlap with the presentation of

the target phoneme, so that the type of question should also not affect
phoneme detection performance or speed (again, unless phonemes are
generally more easily detected in one sentence position than in another, e.g., because the probability of encountering the target phoneme
continuously rises as the question unfolds).
To test whether not phonological processing in particular but rather
auditory processing in general was affected by parallel planning, participants in Experiment 2 were given the same question-answering task
as participants in Experiment 1a, but with the additional task to detect
tones instead of phonemes while hearing the question. Firstly, participants’ verbal response latencies should pattern like in Experiment
1a, indicating that early planning questions indeed led to planning in
overlap with the incoming questions. Secondly, if this tone detection
Experiment shows an effect of question type that matches the predicted
effect of Experiment 1a (worse detection performance when planning
during the presentation of the target phoneme), than this would be
taken as evidence that auditory processing in general is affected by
parallel speech planning. If, however, this Experiment shows no effects
of question type, as predicted for Experiments 1b and 1c, the respective
effects in Experiment 1a would be taken as evidence that phonological
processing in particular is affected by parallel speech planning.
Methods
Participants
Sixty participants were tested in each of the four Experiments. Each
participant took part in only one of the Experiments. Six participants
have been excluded from analyses of Experiment 1a and two have been
excluded from Experiment 1c (see Section ‘Data Coding and Analysis’).
All participants were healthy German native speakers between 18 and
49 years of age who were recruited online via Prolific, gave their
written consent to participate in the data collection, and received
monetary compensation for their participation.
Regarding one experiment in isolation (and ignoring any increase in
measurement reliability due to repeated measures), to attest the effect
of Planning (early/late, see Section ‘Materials and Design’) in a given
experiment would call for 52 participants (Brysbaert, 2019). Further,
sample size recommendations by Brysbaert (2019) to obtain sufficient
power to detect an interaction effect of a 2-level between-subjects
factor and a 2-level within subjects factor for repeated-measures tests
containing a sufficiently large number of items (as we do here, with
60 items tested per participant, see Section ‘Materials and Design’;
see also Brysbaert and Stevens (2018)) range between 90 and 130
participants in total. This would call for 45 to 65 participants per
experiment to reach a power of .8 to detect an interaction of Planning
× Experiment at an alpha level of .05. Testing 60 participants per
Experiment can thus be expected to detect an interaction effect with
an effect size of f = .26 with a power of .8 at an alpha level of .05 and
a simple effect of the within-subjects variable with an effect size of d
= .37 with the same power at the same alpha level, as calculated using
G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007).
Materials and design
In total, 100 German questions were created in two versions that
were used to make the answer to the question known either already
during the question (early-planning condition; e.g.: ‘‘Wenn man Rot
und Gelb mischt, | welche Farbe erhält man dann?’’ (When you mix red
and yellow, | what colour do you get?); the ‘‘|’’ symbol representing
the point in time when the answer to the question can be known)
or only at the very end of the question (late-planning condition; e.g.:
‘‘Welche Farbe erhält man, wenn man Rot und Gelb mischt | ?’’ (What
colour do you get when you mix red and yellow | ?)). Quiz questions
required short responses, mainly single word answers (e.g., ‘‘Berlin’’) or
proper nouns (e.g., ‘‘Neil Armstrong’’). The different versions of each

of the questions required the same answers and were worded almost
identically, only differing in the order of their components (see Table
1).3 Sixty critical questions contained one word starting with one of
the target phonemes [f], [b], [g], or [v] (15 questions for each of the
four target phonemes; each question only featured a single token of
the target phoneme). In the early-planning condition, the answer to the
question could be planned early on during the question. Questions in
this condition contained the word beginning with the target phoneme
towards the end, i.e., after the answer to the question could be known.
Questions in the late-planning condition were designed so that the answer could only be known at the end of the question. Questions in this
condition contained the word beginning with the target phoneme closer
to the question beginning, where the answer to the question could not
yet be known (cf. the underlined ‘F’ in the example above). Thereby,
participants could start to plan their response earlier than when being
presented with the target phoneme in the early-planning condition,
but later than when being presented with the target phoneme in the
late-planning condition. For Experiment 2, the critical questions were
additionally overlaid with 250 ms long sine tones, generated with
Audacity (Audacity Team, 2024), that were played at the position of
the target phonemes. The fifteen questions with the target phoneme
[b] contained a tone of 440 Hz at the position of the [b]; the questions
with the target phoneme [f] contained tones of 520 Hz; the questions
with the target phoneme [g] contained tones of 600 Hz; and the
questions with the target phoneme [v] contained tones of 680 Hz. Forty
questions were designed as filler questions and did not contain a target
phoneme (and therefore also no tone in Experiment 2). All questions
were recorded by a female native speaker of German and had a mean
length of 5393 ms (SD = 1491 ms; 𝑀𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙∕𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑦 = 5248 ms, SD =
1222 ms; 𝑀𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙∕𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒 = 5768 ms, SD = 1514 ms). Two experimental
lists were created, with half of the questions appearing in the earlyplanning condition and half appearing in the late-planning condition
in each list, so that each question was played to any participant in only
one of the conditions. The order of items was randomised within lists
and participants were randomly assigned to one of the two lists.
In Experiment 1c (phoneme detection with subsequent picture naming task), one-hundred pictures of easy-to-name concrete objects were
selected from the MultiPic database (Duñabeitia, Crepaldi, Meyer, New,
Pliatsikas, Smolka, & Brysbaert, 2018) and assigned to the items so as
to be unrelated to the questions or their answers.

lead to valid and reliable measures and effects given sufficiently large
sample sizes (Anwyl-Irvine, Dalmaijer, Hodges, & Evershed, 2021; Fairs
& Strijkers, 2021; Rodd, 2024; Vogt, Hauber, Kuhlen, & Abdel Rahman,
2021).
Experiment 1a: Dual task phoneme monitoring and response planning
In Experiment 1a, participants were auditorily presented with quiz
questions and had to give their answers verbally as fast and accurately
as possible (Fig. 1, panel A). Moreover, they were instructed to monitor
the question for one out of four target phonemes at a time, which
occurred in 60% of the questions (critical items), and to press the space
bar as fast as possible when they heard the target phoneme. The four
target phonemes ([f], [b], [g], or [v]) were monitored in four blocks
of 25 trials each, one block per phoneme, with the order of blocks
being randomised across participants. Each block contained 15 critical
items and 10 filler items, which did not contain the respective target
phoneme in the question.
The experiment began with a sound check to ensure that the voice of
the participants could be recorded. Participants were then introduced
to the verbal quiz task and answered four practice questions as fast
as possible to familiarise themselves with the task. Next, participants
received instructions about the manual phoneme detection task. They
were then presented with a recording of the phoneme they had to focus
on in the first block of 25 questions, followed by a recording containing
a series of twenty single words, ten of which started with the target
phoneme of the first block while the other ten did not contain the target
phoneme. Participants were instructed to press the space bar each time
they recognised the target phoneme in the presented list of words, with
each button press receiving visual feedback in the shape of a space
bar presented on the screen for 500 ms. This familiarisation with the
target phoneme together with the short practice phase preceded each
of the four blocks, instructing participants to monitor the questions of
the respective block for one particular target phoneme ([f], [b], [g], or
[v]).
Each trial began with a fixation cross presented for 1000 ms in the
centre of the screen, followed by the auditorily presented question. In
critical trials, which contained a target phoneme, participants had to
press the space bar as soon as they detected the phoneme. In all trials,
critical as well as filler, participants answered the question verbally as
fast as possible, with their responses being recorded. After giving their
answer, participants could proceed to the next trial by clicking a button
on the screen with their mouse.

Procedure
All four Experiments were tested online via PCIbex (Zehr & Schwarz,
2018) using participants’ own computers, which has been shown to

Experiment 1b: Single task phoneme monitoring (no verbal response)
The design, materials, and procedure of the single control task in
Experiment 1b were identical to Experiment 1a, with the difference that
participants in Experiment 1b were instructed that they did not have to
give any verbal responses to the quiz questions and only had to perform
the phoneme detection task (Fig. 1, panel B). Also, participants did not
go through a practice phase for the verbal response task.

Note that in Experiments 1b and 1c, participants were not required to
answer the questions. For the sake of comparison, the two question types will
still be referred to as ’early planning questions’ and ’late planning questions’
in these conditions, even though no response planning is required.

and 2) or picture onset (Exp. 1c) to response onset. Participants’
button press accuracy and latencies (from target phoneme/tone onset) were logged during the experiment. All data were analysed in
R (R. Core Team, 2023) using the packages lme4 (Bates, Mächler,
Bolker, & Walker, 2015) to build (generalised) linear mixed-effects
regression models, lmerTest (Kuznetsova, Brockhoff, & Christensen,
2017) to assess the statistical significance of single predictors, and
emmeans (Lenth, 2022) to conduct post-hoc tests to assess the significance of simple effects by comparing estimated marginal means of
factor levels based on F -tests with Kenward-Roger approximations of
degrees of freedom (Fox & Weisberg, 2011; Halekoh & Hojsgaard, 2014;
Kenward & Roger, 1997; Searle, Speed, & Milliken, 1980), correcting
significance levels for multiple testing using multivariate t adjustment.
Three subjects in Exp. 1a were discarded from the analysis, since their
verbal responses were either not given or not recorded. Three more
subjects in Exp. 1a were excluded from analyses, because they did not
perform the phoneme detection task. Two subjects in Exp. 1c were
discarded since their audio was not recorded during the testing session.
Two items were discarded from the analyses of Exp. 1a and 1b due to
technical errors. 719 trials in Exp. 1a, 166 trials in Exp. 1c, and 762
trials in Exp. 2 containing wrong answers or ‘I don’t know’ answers
to the quiz questions or the picture naming task were discarded from
the analyses. 70 trials from Exp. 1a, 193 trials from Exp. 1b, 239 trials

Experiment 1c: Dual-task phoneme monitoring and subsequent picture naming
The design, materials, and procedure of Experiment 1c were identical to Experiment 1b, with the difference that participants in Experiment 1c were instructed that, in addition to the phoneme detection
task, they had to name a picture that would appear after each question
as fast as possible (Fig. 1, panel C). The picture was presented 500 ms
after question offset and disappeared when subjects clicked the proceed
button with their mouse to continue with the next trial. The objects
presented in the pictures were unrelated to the respective questions or
their answers, so that the speech planning task would not be related to
the listening task.
Experiment 2: Dual task tone detection and response planning
The design, materials, and procedure of Experiment 2 were identical
to Experiment 1a, with the difference that participants in Experiment
2 were instructed that they had to do a tone detection task instead
of a phoneme detection task (Fig. 1, panel D). Also, the practice and
familiarisation parts of the experiment used tones in place of phonemes.
Data coding and analysis
Participants’ verbal response latencies in Exp. 1a and 2 (answers to
questions) and Exp. 1c (picture naming) were measured manually in

Exp. 1a and 1b was not merely due to the fact that Exp. 1a contained
a speech planning task on top of the phoneme detection task. A significant interaction of Planning and Experiment was attested comparing
detection rates when the questions had to be answered (Exp. 1a) vs.
not answered (Exp. 1b) (p < .001). This interaction was not significant
in the comparison of the picture naming task (Exp. 1c) vs. no verbal
response task (Exp. 1b), nor in the comparison of the no verbal response
task (Exp. 1b) vs. tone detection plus question answering task (Exp. 2).

effect was due to a significant effect of Planning in Exp. 1a, with
significantly more undetected target phonemes in early planning trials
than in late planning trials (𝛽 = −1.399; SE = 0.169; z = −8.274; p
< .001), indicating that phoneme detection accuracy was lower during
concurrent speech planning than without concurrent speech planning.
This effect was not significant Exp. 1b or 1c, which did not feature
speech planning during the target phoneme (Exp. 1b: 𝛽 = −0.191; SE
= 0.182; z = −1.047; p = .295; Exp. 1c: 𝛽 = −0.251; SE = 0.177;
z = −1.413; p = .157), supporting that concurrent speech planning
is indeed the driving factor of the effect of Planning in Exp. 1a. The
effect of Planning was also not significant in Exp. 2, which required
participants to detect tones instead of phonemes while answering the
question (𝛽 = −0.640; SE = 0.419; z = −1.528; p = .126), suggesting
that speech planning affects phoneme detection accuracy but not tone
detection accuracy.

from Exp. 1c, and 5 trials from Exp. 2 with erroneous button presses
that were given before the target phoneme/tone was presented were
discarded. In total, 72.3% of the critical trials originally presented to
the 54 valid participants of Exp. 1a, 92.1% of the 60 participants of
Exp. 1b, 88.3% of the 58 participants of Exp. 1c, and 78.6% of the
60 participants of Exp. 2 were retained for analyses. For the results
presented here, filler trials were not analysed.
Results
The main question of the study is whether language comprehension
on the phonological level is impaired during concurrent speech planning. To target this question, phoneme and tone detection performance
in the early planning condition versus the late planning condition will
be analysed and compared between the present experiments. To test
whether participants indeed planned their verbal responses early in the
early planning conditions, verbal response latencies are analysed at the
end of this section.

Phoneme and tone detection latencies
To test whether phoneme/tone detection latencies match the results pattern of detection accuracies and/or whether speech planning
generally affects manual response latencies in the present experiments,
detection latencies in the early versus late planning condition were
compared between experiments. Analysing the trials in which the target
phoneme/tone was correctly detected (see caption of Fig. 3), a linear
mixed-effects regression model was built to estimate detection latencies
in these trials, with Planning and Experiment as well as their interaction as fixed predictors and Phoneme/Tone as an additional control
predictor.6 The model contained random intercepts by subject and by
item and random slopes of Planning by subject and by item (Fig. 3).7
Planning and Experiment were dummy coded, with early planning and
the single-task Experiment 1b as reference levels. Phoneme/Tone was
deviation coded.
Detection latencies in Exp. 1b were found to be significantly slower
in late planning trials as compared to early planning trials (Table 4;
𝛽 = 61 ms; SE = 25 ms; p = .016), indicating that target phonemes
are generally detected faster when they appear later in the question.
Similarly, detection latencies in Exp. 1c (picture naming task) were also
significantly slower in late planning trials compared to early planning
trials (𝛽 = 52 ms; SE = 26 ms; p = .044, as attested by post-hoc
tests), corroborating the result of Exp. 1b. Contrarily, in Exp. 1a, where
participants verbally responded to the question, detection latencies
were found to be significantly faster in late planning trials as compared
to early planning trials (𝛽 = −102 ms; SE = 30 ms; p < .001, as attested
by post-hoc tests), indicating that button press latencies were greater
during concurrent planning than while not concurrently planning. This
led to a significant interaction of Planning and Experiment when comparing Exp. 1a and 1b (p < .001). Like in Exp. 1a, detection latencies
in Exp. 2 were found to be significantly faster in late planning trials as
compared to early planning trials (𝛽 = −114 ms; SE = 25 ms; p < .001,
as attested by post-hoc tests), also indicating that button presses were
slower while planning than while not planning, and also leading to
a significant interaction of Planning and Experiment when comparing
Exp. 2 and 1b (p < .001).

Detection tasks
Phoneme and tone detection accuracy
To test whether phoneme and/or tone detection rates were worse
during concurrent speech planning, detection rates in the early versus late planning condition were compared between the present experiments. In the four experiments, different proportions of target
phonemes/tones went undetected (see Table 2 and Fig. 2). A generalised linear mixed-effects model was built to estimate the proportion of trials with successful phoneme/tone detection4 using Planning
and Experiment as well as their interaction as fixed predictors and
Phoneme/Tone as an additional control predictor. The model contained
random intercepts by subject and by item and random slopes of Planning by subject and by item as well as random slopes of Experiment
by item.5 Planning and Experiment were dummy coded, with early
planning and the single-task Exp. 1b as reference levels. Phoneme/Tone
was deviation coded.
No significant difference was found in subjects’ phoneme detection
performance in early vs. late planning questions when participants did
not have to give a verbal response (Exp. 1b) (Table 3), indicating that
the position of the target phoneme in the question did not affect participants’ detection accuracy in itself. When participants had to verbally
answer the question (Exp. 1a), significantly more target phonemes were
not detected compared to Exp. 1b in the early planning condition (p
< .001), indicating that phoneme detection accuracy is reduced during
concurrent speech planning. In contrast, when participants had to name
a picture after the question had been presented (Exp. 1c), detection
rates in early planning trials were not found to be significantly different
from Exp. 1b, indicating that the difference in detection rates between

Since in Exp. 2 the critical tones were played at the moments of the
phonemes that were critical in Exp. 1a, 1b, and 1c, the critical tones and
the respective critical phonemes were treated as the same for the sake of this
analysis, making up a single factor with four levels ([b]/440 Hz, [f]/520 Hz,
[g]/600 Hz, [v]/680 Hz).

To additionally test for a relation of phoneme/tone detection latencies with verbal response latencies in the Experiments that required a
verbal response to the question (Exp. 1a and 2), an additional model
was built, estimating detection latencies with verbal response latencies as an additional predictor next to Planning and Experiment and
their interaction (see Table A.3 in the Appendix). Phoneme/Tone was
added as a control variable.8 The model contained random intercepts

early planning and Exp. 1a (phoneme detection) as reference levels.
Phoneme/tone was deviation coded. This model’s output shows that
verbal response latencies and phoneme detection latencies are linearly
correlated in Exp. 1a, with early planning trials with longer verbal
response latencies showing later button presses (p < .001). While going
in the same direction, this effect is smaller in late planning trials, as

phonological, but not general auditory input processing is reduced during concurrent speech planning. However, tone detection performance
in Exp. 2 was at ceiling in both planning conditions, which might have
covered up a possible interference effect of concurrent planning on tone
detection. We will return to this point again in the discussion below.
In line with the results on participants’ phoneme detection accuracy,
phoneme detections in the main dual-task experiment (Exp. 1a) were
found to be significantly slower in the early planning condition, in
which speech planning happened in overlap with the target phoneme,
than in the late planning condition, in which phoneme detection was
performed without concurrent speech planning. The fact that this effect
was only obtained when the question had to be answered verbally
(Exp. 1a) but not when no response planning was required (Exp. 1b and
1c) shows that it is indeed due to speech planning in overlap rather than
to the position of the respective target phonemes in the two sentence
formats. Just as phoneme detection latencies in Exp. 1a, tone detection
latencies in Exp. 2 were also found to be significantly slower in the early
planning condition than in the late planning condition. This finding was
to be expected, since speech planning has previously been shown to impair processes of (minute) motor control and hence affects the manual
component of the phoneme/tone detection tasks in the present button
press experiments. Earlier studies found speakers’ motor activity to be
impaired during phases of taxing speech planning, e.g., during mousetracking of an object on the screen, finger tapping, or driving (Boiteau,
Malone, Peters, & Almor, 2014; Drews, Pasupathi, & Strayer, 2008;
Sjerps & Meyer, 2015, see also below), possibly because at least some
components of the manual detection task (like planning and executing
the finger movement) and the speech preparation task (like planning
and preparing the movement of the involved articulators) are carried
out by processing mechanisms that are shared by these two tasks.
The verbal response latencies of the answers given to the quiz
questions in the phoneme detection dual-task experiment (Exp. 1a)
and the tone detection dual-task experiment (Exp. 2) were significantly faster in the early planning condition, where speech planning
and phoneme/tone monitoring are executed concurrently, than in the
late planning condition, where phoneme/tone monitoring and speech
planning are executed consecutively, showing that subjects did indeed
plan their answers in overlap with the incoming questions, if possible.
This result is in line with previous findings on early planning strategies
in dialogue situations (e.g., Barthel et al. (2016) on German; Barthel
and Levinson (2020) and Bögels (2020) on Dutch; Corps et al. (2018)
on English). Notably, response latencies in the late planning condition
were particularly long in trials in which the critical phoneme was not
detected. Since phonemes in the late planning condition were certainly
not missed because of concurrent speech planning, these (rare) misses
must be due to temporarily low levels of attention spent on the experimental task, which also lead to slow verbal responses in these trials.
Moreover, verbal response latencies and phoneme detection latencies
were positively correlated, with trials with longer verbal response
times showing later reactions to the encounter of the target phonemes.
This correlation was not found for verbal response latencies and tone
detection latencies. These results are in line with previous research
finding that both language comprehension and speech planning require
attention (e.g., Cohen, Salondy, Pallier, & Dehaene, 2021; Roelofs,
2021; Roelofs & Piai, 2011).
Taken together, the obtained findings clearly support the planningprioritised hypothesis. Participants were shown to plan their responses

found, and no significant interaction of Detection and Planning.
Discussion
This study investigated whether phonological input processing during turn taking is less accurate while concurrently planning speech than
while not concurrently planning speech, as predicted by the planningprioritised hypothesis (in contrast to the comprehension-prioritised hypothesis). The reported experiments required participants to perform
a manual phoneme detection task either in isolation (Exp. 1b), in
combination with a verbal question response task (Exp. 1a), or in
combination with a delayed picture naming task (Exp. 1c). Questions
were presented in two versions, either allowing participants to start to
plan their answer before the target phoneme appeared in the question
(early planning condition) or allowing them to plan the answer only
after the target phoneme had been presented (late planning condition).
Participants were found to show significantly reduced phoneme
detection performance when they were concurrently planning their
response to the quiz question (i.e., in the early planning condition in
Exp. 1a) as compared to when they were not (yet) planning their verbal
response (i.e., in Exp. 1b and 1c and in the late planning condition
in Exp. 1a). The finding that question format (early planning question
versus late planning question) affected phoneme detection accuracy
only in Exp. 1a shows that the effect on detection performance was
not due to the position of the target phoneme in the question but to
concurrent planning of the answer in the early planning condition in
Exp. 1a.
In an additional experiment (Exp. 2), participants were required to
verbally answer the questions and perform a tone detection task, with
the target tones presented at the positions of the phonemes that were
the target phonemes in Exp. 1a. In contrast to the phoneme detection
accuracy in Exp. 1a, participants’ tone detection accuracy in Exp. 2
was not found to be impaired by concurrent planning, suggesting that
10

to the questions as early as possible, which was in overlap with part of
the question in the early planning condition. When processing capacities were supposedly insufficient, which was most frequent in early
planning questions in Exp. 1a, the target phonemes were not detected.
In late planning questions, detection misses were much less frequent
and most probably due to a momentary lack of attention to the experimental task. In these rare cases, this lack of attention also lead to slower
verbal response latencies. This conclusion finds support in the fact that
questions that are particularly taxing, and thus get slower responses,
were found to also show significantly reduced detection performance
as compared to questions that get faster responses.
The attested pattern of results can be explained in two plausible,
interconnected ways. As one possible, domain-general explanation,
reduced phoneme detection performance in the early planning condition in Exp. 1a might be caused by divided attention and increased
processing load during parallel speech planning and comprehension.
Alternatively, reduced phoneme detection task performance might be
driven by domain-specific interference between the processes of speech
planning and language decoding, especially on the level of phonological processing. Each of these two accounts will be discussed in the
following paragraphs.
Attention plays a crucial role in managing conversations in general and verbal turn taking in particular. Understanding and planning speech are complex cognitive tasks that rely heavily on attention (Chwilla, 2022; He et al., 2021; Hubbard & Federmeier, 2021;
Jongman, Roelofs, & Meyer, 2015; Kristensen, Wang, Petersson, &
Hagoort, 2013; Laganaro, Bonnans, & Fargier, 2019; Moisala et al.,
2015; Shitova, Roelofs, Coughler, & Schriefers, 2017). Phases of speech
planning in overlap with input decoding can therefore temporarily
exhaust the limited capacity of attentional resources, as has been
demonstrated in previous dual-task studies. For instance, Ferreira and
Pashler (2002) demonstrated that in dual-tasks involving discriminating tones while preparing to name a picture, both picture naming
performance and tone discrimination performance were reduced in
difficult naming conditions (e.g., naming low-frequency words after
low-cloze context sentences) as compared to easy naming conditions
(e.g., naming high-frequency words after high-cloze context sentences),
indicating that more difficult speech planning tasks lead to increased
attentional demand. Investigating actual conversations, Boiteau et al.
(2014) found that interlocutors’ performance of continuously tracking
a moving dot with their mouse was reduced during phases of speech
planning, where speech comprehension and preparation regularly overlap. Similarly, Sjerps and Meyer (2015) found that participants who had
to continuously tap their fingers in a pre-defined pattern while taking
turns with the computer to name rows of pictures showed reduced
tapping performance already shortly before the end of the incoming
turn, i.e., just as they planned their own turn in overlap with speech
comprehension. And a number of earlier experiments showed that both
speech production and speech planning reduce concurrent driving performance (e.g., Kubose et al., 2006), which leads drivers to make use of
numerous, partly multi-modal strategies to manage the attentional demand of the multi-task situation (Drews et al., 2008; Mondada, 2012).
Thus, both language production planning and speech comprehension
require attentional resources, which can lead to capacity limitations
during phases of simultaneous processing.
The competition for attention of concurrent speech planning and
comprehension has been shown to lead to increased processing load
at turn transitions. In a controlled experimental setting in which participants exchanged conditionally relevant speaking turns with a confederate, Barthel and Sauppe (2019) found that participants’ pupil
sizes, an indicator for cognitive load (Beatty & Lucero-Wagoner, 2000),
increased more intensely and for longer when they were planning their
turns in overlap with the incoming turn as compared to when they
planned their turn in silence after the incoming turn. This pattern has
been confirmed in question-response sequences taken from unrestricted

conversations (Barthel & Rühlemann, 2025), showing that conversational dual-tasking is cognitively taxing, even though it has been shown
to be a common turn taking strategy (e.g., Bögels, 2020; Levinson
& Torreira, 2015). Notably, the increase in processing load at turn
transitions is not dependent on the actual articulation of the planned
speech but has also been observed in potential next speakers in triadic
conversations who do not actually produce the next turn but were
merely co-selected as a potential next speaker (Rühlemann & Barthel,
2025).
In light of these previous findings, attention capacity limitations
during phases of speech planning are a plausible candidate explanation
for the observed reduced performance in phonological input processing. Both comprehension and production are known to be dependent on speakers’ domain-general aptitude and information-processing
speed (Hintz et al., 2020). Limitations in general processing resources
or a processing bottleneck (Ferreira & Pashler, 2002; Kahneman, 1973;
Navon & Miller, 2002; Pashler, 2000; Ruthruff, Pashler, & Klaassen,
2001; Tombu & Jolicœ ur, 2003, 2005) are thus conceivable causes
of the reduced phoneme detection performance, and would explain
the obtained pattern of results. Both phoneme detection accuracy and
latencies were lower and longer, respectively, when subjects were
planning their verbal response at the time when the target phoneme
was encountered. Moreover, even in trials in which planning and
comprehension did not overlap, verbal response latencies were longer
when the critical phoneme was missed as compared to when it was
detected. The same pattern holds the other way around, with late
planning trials (where comprehension and planning did not overlap)
showing a negative relation between phoneme detection rates and
verbal response latencies, with more target phonemes being missed in
trials with longer verbal response latencies. In line with these results,
verbal response latencies and phoneme detection latencies were also
found to be correlated, with trials with longer verbal reaction times
also showing longer phoneme detection latencies. The combination of
these findings indicates that a general momentary lapse of attention can
affect both the processes of speech planning and phoneme detection.
An alternative, related approach to explain the reduced performance
in phoneme detection during parallel speech planning centres around
domain-specific dual-task interference. Speech production and comprehension are both assumed to operate on highly interconnected, if not
partly identical mental representations (Indefrey & Levelt, 2004; Kempen, Olsthoorn, & Sprenger, 2012; MacKay, 1987), including coupled
phonological representations (Buchsbaum, Hickok, & Humphries, 2001;
Kittredge & Dell, 2016; Mitterer & Ernestus, 2008), and to operate on
at least partly overlapping neural systems (Hagoort & Indefrey, 2014;
Menenti et al., 2011; Silbert et al., 2014). When production and comprehension processes try to access the target representations at the same
time, task performance is known to decrease. Abundant evidence for
such interference effects comes from picture-word-interference experiments, which show that linguistic input can have detrimental effects
on picture naming performance (e.g., Damian & Bowers, 2003; Glaser
& Diingelhoff, 1984; Jescheniak, Schriefers, & Hantsch, 2003; Levelt
et al., 1999). As a general finding of these studies, the observed
interference of speech input with speech production is reduced when
the input is phonologically similar to the intended output (Damian &
Martin, 1999; Schriefers et al., 1990) (see also Barthel & Levinson,
2020, for related evidence in lexical decision). The standard explanation for this phonological similarity effect is that any input activates its
respective phonological representations, which compete with the target
representations that need to be selected to produce the output, causing
phonological interference. Thus, any phonological overlap between
input and output leads to activation of the output-relevant representations by the input, leading to reduced interference. This explanation
is supported by findings of dual-task experiments that show that a
picture naming task can be performed more easily with a concurrent
tone-discrimination task than with a concurrent syllable-identification
task (Fairs, Bögels, & Meyer, 2018); an effect that has been argued to

be due to the fact that non-linguistic tones, contrary to syllables, do
not activate competing linguistic representations. Corroborating results
come from a phoneme monitoring study by Roelofs, Özdemir, and
Levelt (2007), in which participants were presented with single spoken
words and found to show shorter phoneme monitoring latencies when
the name of a picture that was presented simultaneously also contained
the target phoneme. Importantly, this phoneme priming effect was
not found when subjects never had to react to the presented pictures
in any way, which shows that speech production, including active
phonological encoding, is the source of the obtained interference effect.
Based on these previous results, both attentional capacity limitations during dual-task phases as well as phonological interference of
speech planning with phonological decoding are plausible candidate
explanations for the reduction of phonological input processing efficiency during verbal response planning. Moreover, these two causes
are not mutually exclusive and might in fact both have a share in
the observed net effects. However, given the present results of the
dual-task of tone detection and question answering in Exp. 2, languagespecific effects seem to be the more likely (main) cause of the observed
effects on phoneme detection performance in Exp. 1a. Tone detection
accuracy was found to be equally high during phases of concurrent
speech planning and phases without concurrent speech planning in
Exp. 2, indicating that interference between response planning and
input processing, especially on the phonological level, is the more likely
reason for the observed decline in phoneme detection performance during speech planning in Exp. 1a than domain general attention capacity
limitations. These results suggest that phonological input processing in
particular is impaired during phases of concurrent speech planning in
turn taking situations.
The absence of an effect of concurrent speech planning of tone
detection performance in Exp. 2 needs to be interpreted with some
caution, though. In both the early and the late planning conditions,
tone detection performance is almost at ceiling for many of the tested
participants. This limits the certainty about these results’ interpretation,
due to the possibility that any detrimental effect of concurrent planning
on tone detection was not detected because the tone detection task was
too easy even in the early planning condition. Future studies could directly target this remaining uncertainty by testing a dual-task scenario
that balances the level of difficulty between the language-related and
the language-unrelated task more carefully. Furthermore, the phoneme
detection task and the tone detection task are inherently not perfectly
comparable, since in the tone detection task, participants need to pay
attention to a part of the incoming signal that is not only not part of the
phonological makeup of the input that needs to be comprehended for
the quiz task, but also is it not part of the linguistic signal in general.
Thus, the two tasks differ from one another in more than one respect,
leaving some uncertainty about why exactly concurrent planning did
not affect tone detection performance: only because the target tones
are not part of the phonological signal of the input or because they are
entirely non-linguistic. For the rational of this study’s manipulations
and comparisons, however, this was unavoidable.
Regardless of the respective shares of phonological versus general
auditory processing in the observed net effect in the present dual-task
study, phoneme detection has been shown to be more difficult during
phases of concurrent speech planning, even though parallel processing
of verbal input and output is a common strategy of interlocutors in
turn taking situations (e.g., Barthel et al., 2017; Bögels et al., 2015).
One reason why interlocutors commonly pursue this strategy in spite
of these processing difficulties is that they are thereby able to start
to articulate their responses with shorter gaps between turns of talk,
making more efficient use of the time spent in conversation (Bögels
& Levinson, 2017; Levinson & Torreira, 2015). A second reason for an
overlapping processes strategy is that being able to produce timely wellaligned turns avoids any potentially unwanted mis-interpretations that
might be triggered by speaking after a markedly long gap, which has
been shown to lead to inferences of, for example, social distance (Blohm

& Barthel, 2025) or low willingness to grant a request or accept an
offer (Henetz, 2017; Roberts & Francis, 2013). A third and very fundamental reason lies in the basic systematics of turn allocation during
conversation (Sacks et al., 1974). Whenever speaker transition becomes
relevant during a conversation and the now-open speaking floor is
not taken by the listener of the previous turn, the previous speaker
might self-select again for the next turn and the present opportunity
for the listener to take a turn is gone. This tension is obviously even
more pronounced in multi-party interactions, where situations in which
more than one current listener is entitled to take the next turn are
common (Holler et al., 2021; Rühlemann & Barthel, 2025).
In sum, planning in overlap is a frequently employed strategy, even
though its execution is less efficient than planning in silence (Barthel &
Sauppe, 2019). The presented evidence indicates that not only is planning less efficient in overlap with comprehension but comprehension
efficiency is also reduced during concurrent planning (see also Fargier
& Laganaro, 2019). After related evidence had been put forth for
language comprehension on the level of semantic processing (Barthel,
2021), the present results show that also phonological input processing
is reduced during parallel speech planning in dialogical turn taking situations, lending further support to the planning-prioritised hypothesis.
