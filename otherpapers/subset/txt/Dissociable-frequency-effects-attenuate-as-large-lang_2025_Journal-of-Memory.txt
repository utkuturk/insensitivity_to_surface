Introduction
A long-standing core research agenda of psycholinguistics is to
provide an account of the cognitive mechanism underlying human
sentence processing. In other words, what are the processes that enable
the rapid and efficient comprehension of linguistic input? How is this
achieved in real time with limited cognitive resources? Decades of
psycholinguistics research have highlighted the role of prediction in
sentence processing (for overviews, see Kuperberg & Jaeger, 2016;
Staub, 2015), which has received support from a large body of experimental and computational studies showing how predictive processing
influences real-time reading behavior. However, there are still largely
open questions about the characteristics and scope of prediction in
human sentence processing, such as whether the increased processing
difficulty observed at low-frequency words is also a by-product of
predictive processing or driven by a separate lexical access mechanism.
Previous experiments that factorially manipulate frequency and
predictability have reported independent effects of the two factors
on reading times (Kretzschmar, Schlesewsky, & Staub, 2015; Staub
& Benatar, 2013), which have provided support for the latter view.

However, stimuli in psycholinguistic experiments are usually short and
presented in isolation without much surrounding context, which raises
concerns about their ecological validity (Hasson & Honey, 2012). This
can be addressed through naturalistic experiments, where subjects are
instructed to read naturalistic stimuli (e.g. short stories, newspaper
articles). The resulting data is then analyzed by first operationalizing
constructs of interest like frequency and predictability, and then evaluating how much separate variance they explain. Often, predictability
is operationalized by surprisal (i.e. negative log probabilities) from
Transformer-based large language models (LLMs), which are artificial
neural networks that are trained to predict upcoming words in a
corpus. While surprisal from such LLMs has been shown to be predictive of measures of processing difficulty such as self-paced reading
times and eye fixation durations (Shain, Meister, Pimentel, Cotterell,
& Levy, 2024), the precise hypotheses about predictive processing
that they represent remain unclear due to the opaque nature of their
computations.
However, it has been shown that factors like the number of model
parameters and the amount of training data have a reliable effect on

the fit of LLM surprisal to measures of processing difficulty. More
specifically, LLMs that have more parameters and are trained on more
data generally yield surprisal estimates that are poorer predictors of
processing difficulty that manifests in naturalistic reading times (Oh
& Schuler, 2023a, 2023b). This appears to be driven by the LLMs’
capability to predict rare words accurately, which is readily learned
with more parameters and large amounts of training data (Oh, Yue, &
Schuler, 2024). In addition to providing an explanation for the discrepancy between LLMs and human-like predictive processing, this finding
has crucial methodological implications for studying whether frequency
effects are separable from predictability effects in naturalistic reading (e.g. Goodkind & Bicknell, 2021; Shain, 2019, 2024). That is, given
this strong relationship between word frequency and LLM surprisal,
using surprisal from larger models trained on more data is likely to
result in an underestimate of predictability effects and an overestimate
of frequency effects, as the excessive number of parameters and training
data effectively serves to wash out difficulty associated with infrequent
words that could otherwise be explained by predictability.
The present article demonstrates this point by conducting regression analyses on multiple reading time datasets that span different
languages, modalities, and genres, using LLMs that vary in model size
and training data amount. The results reveal a robust positive effect of
both model size and training data amount of the LLM on the ability
of word frequency to predict human reading times, which indicates
that frequency compensates for surprisal to a greater degree as bigger
LLMs trained on more data are used to calculate surprisal. Subsequent
follow-up analyses examine how the increase in model size helps the
prediction of low-frequency tokens. To this end, low-frequency tokens
are first categorized according to factors informed by architectural
properties of Transformers and contemporary language modeling practices, whose learning trajectories are subsequently analyzed. The results
show that the influence of model size is strongest on tokens that are not
part of a bigram sequence observed earlier in the context, which cannot
be predicted by simply copying. This suggests that the limitations in
model size may cause a bottleneck for learning specific associations
during training, which results in less accurate predictions of the correct
token, improved fit to human reading times, and a correspondingly
lower contribution due to frequency.
To contextualize the article, the remainder of this section defines
Transformer-based LLMs, draws a theoretical connection to human
sentence processing, provides a review of empirical work on the dissociability of frequency effects and predictability effects, and introduces
the framework of continuous-time deconvolutional regressive neural
network for modeling reading times.

LLMs as models of next-word prediction trained on large-scale corpora. Therefore, throughout this article, LLMs refer specifically to
autoregressive language models that have not been adapted to specific
tasks.
Theoretical link between LLMs and human sentence processing
There are two conceptually similar senses in which LLMs are relevant for studying human sentence processing. The first is as a computational model based on surprisal theory (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008), which
posits that the processing difficulty of a word in context is proportional
to its surprisal (Shannon, 1948), or negative log probability. Surprisal
theory views prediction as ongoing probabilistic inference over possible
structure- or message-level analyses given the context, which are continuously updated upon observing the bottom-up input (e.g. reading
the next word). Assuming that the human comprehender maintains
multiple probabilistic analyses in parallel, surprisal of the observed
word is equivalent to the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the
probability distribution over analyses before observing the word and after observing it (Levy, 2008). Therefore, surprisal has the interpretation
of the amount of ‘cognitive effort’ taken to readjust the analyses after
observing a word. As such, early surprisal-based processing models
explicitly modeled this process of probabilistic inference, mostly in the
form of maintaining and updating partial syntactic structures generated
by probabilistic incremental parsers. Examples of incremental parsers
that have been applied as models of sentence processing include Earley
parsers (Hale, 2001), top-down parsers (Roark, Bachrach, Cardenas, &
Pallier, 2009), Recurrent Neural Network Grammars (Dyer, Kuncoro,
Ballesteros, & Smith, 2016; Hale, Dyer, Kuncoro, & Brennan, 2018),
and left-corner parsers (Jin & Schuler, 2020; van Schijndel, Exley, &
Schuler, 2013). Naturally, these models were employed to study the
role of syntactic expectation in human sentence processing.
Non-structural ‘sequential’ language models, which do not explicitly
maintain multiple structure- or message-level representations of the
partial sentence, have also been evaluated as expectation-based models
of human sentence processing, as they directly define and estimate a
conditional probability distribution necessary for surprisal calculation.
As neural networks were increasingly being trained as language models, surprisal estimates from both 𝑛-gram language models and those
based on neural network architectures1 such as Simple Recurrent Networks (Elman, 1991), Long Short-Term Memory networks (Hochreiter
& Schmidhuber, 1997), Gated Recurrent Unit networks (Cho et al.,
2014), and Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have been evaluated
against behavioral measures of processing difficulty (Aurnhammer &
Frank, 2019; Fossum & Levy, 2012; Goodkind & Bicknell, 2018; Hao,
Mendelsohn, Sterneck, Martinez, & Frank, 2020; Merkx & Frank, 2021;
Smith & Levy, 2013; Wilcox, Gauthier, Hu, Qian, & Levy, 2020). In
addition to high-level neural network architectures, this line of research
also studies the impact of factors that influence language model probabilities on the fit of surprisal, such as the amount of input context or
various decoding strategies (Kuribayashi, Oseki, Brassard, & Inui, 2022;
Liu, Škrjanec, & Demberg, 2024).
The other closely related sense in which LLMs are relevant for
human sentence processing is quantifying predictability in psycholinguistic experiments, or how predictable the word is given its context.
Probabilities derived from data collected through the cloze task (Taylor, 1953) have traditionally been used to demonstrate the effect
of predictability on real-time processing in early psycholinguistic research (Ehrlich & Rayner, 1981; Kutas & Hillyard, 1980, 1984). However, it is prohibitively expensive to collect data using the cloze task
on various stimuli of interest, as large samples are required for reliable
estimates of predictability. Additionally, even with large samples, it

Transformer-based large language models
LLMs are a class of language models that are trained on the incontext word prediction objective. These models are typically based on
the Transformer neural network architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017),
which does not maintain a vector representation of the context that is
updated at each timestep (cf. recurrent neural networks; Elman, 1991;
Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) but newly calculates a contextualized
representation at each timestep through its self-attention mechanism.
More specifically, autoregressive language models (e.g. Brown et al.,
2020; Radford et al., 2019) are trained to predict the ‘next’ word
given the sequence of previous words, and are therefore closer to the
traditional definition of language models. These models are typically
trained on large amounts of Internet text, although the exact details
about their training data are usually not disclosed.
More recent approaches also employ reinforcement learning and use
predicted human preferences for the generated response as a reward to
fine-tune language models to general-purpose dialogue agents (e.g. reinforcement learning from human feedback; OpenAI, 2023; Ouyang
et al., 2022). However, such methods entail a domain shift in their
probability distribution and thereby weakens the interpretation of

is often difficult to make fine-grained distinctions at the low end of
the predictability scale, as many words are unobserved as responses
to the cloze task. In order to mitigate these issues with the cloze
task, more recent research has begun to rely on predictability estimates that are approximated using corpus statistics. These estimates
include conditional probabilities from bigram (Boston, Hale, Kliegl,
Patil, & Vasishth, 2008; McDonald & Shillcock, 2003), trigram (Smith
& Levy, 2013), 5-gram (Shain, 2019), and Simple Recurrent Network
language models (Hofmann, Remus, Biemann, Radach, & Kuchinke,
2022). From this perspective, Transformer-based LLMs are appealing
as more accurate approximations of corpus statistics (cf. computational models of predictive processing that relate linguistic input to
intermediate representations) in that they are trained to estimate
probabilities based on very large amounts of text and can condition
on a large number of preceding words, unlike earlier 𝑛-gram models.
As such, conditional probabilities from LLMs have recently been used
to examine the shape of the linking function between predictability
and reading times (Hoover, Sonderegger, Piantadosi, & O’Donnell,
2023; Shain et al., 2024) and whether frequency effects dissociate from
predictability effects in naturalistic reading (Shain, 2024).

model size and training data amount on the ability of LLM surprisal
to predict human reading times (Oh et al., 2024). It is therefore likely
that different estimates of frequency effects could be derived depending
on the LLM used to operationalize predictability in a modeling study
using naturalistic reading times. We illustrate this point through an
experiment that closely follows the procedures of Shain (2024), as well
as an experiment using multilingual reading time data.
Continuous-time deconvolutional regressive neural network
Shain (2024) studies the dissociation of frequency and predictability
effects at scale using the modeling framework of continuous-time deconvolutional regressive neural network (CDR-NN; Shain, 2021; Shain
& Schuler, 2024), which we also employ in our first experiment.
While standard approaches like linear mixed-effects models (LMEM;
Bates, Mächler, Bolker, & Walker, 2015) and generalized additive
models (GAM; Wood, 2006) are typically used to study human reading
times (e.g. Hoover et al., 2023; Oh & Schuler, 2023b; Wilcox et al.,
2020), these modeling approaches assume that the current response
reading time 𝑦𝑖 depends solely on the corresponding predictors 𝐱𝑖
and is independent of any preceding predictors. This limits LMEMs
and GAMs in capturing the lingering influence of the current word
on future reading times, which is well-known as ‘spillover’ effects in
psycholinguistics (Rayner, Carlson, & Frazier, 1983; Vasishth, 2006).
While this issue is commonly addressed by including ‘spillover variants’
of predictors from preceding words as predictors of the current response
reading time, this may lead to identifiability issues in LMEM/GAMs and
additionally makes the assumption that previously processed words are
dispersed evenly throughout time.
Continuous-time deconvolutional regression (CDR; Shain & Schuler,
2021) was developed to address these limitations by estimating a
parametric continuous-time impulse response function (e.g. the threeparameter shifted Gamma function) in a data-driven manner. CDR-NN
models are extensions of CDR models based on deep neural networks
that estimate a nonlinear function that relates a set of predictors
(e.g. unigram surprisal) to its effect on the parameters of the predictive
distribution over the response (i.e. reading times) with some continuous
time delay. In doing so, CDR-NN models additionally relax assumptions
that the influence of the predictor on the response is linear and homoscedastic (constant error), which are also implausible for modeling
the time course of naturalistic reading (Shain & Schuler, 2024).

Dissociability of frequency and predictability effects
It is a well-established finding in experimental psycholinguistics that
less frequent words take longer to read (Juhasz & Rayner, 2006; Just &
Carpenter, 1980; Rayner & Duffy, 1986). However, different theoretical
views about sentence processing have posited different explanations for
this effect. A procedural view of sentence processing, which emphasizes
the role of retrieval, integration, and construction of meaning (Gibson,
2000; Lewis & Vasishth, 2005), argues that this frequency effect is
due to differential encoding strength in the mental lexicon, where
more frequent words have stronger representations that are easier to
retrieve (Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, & Ziegler, 2001; Just &
Carpenter, 1980; Reichle, Pollatsek, Fisher, & Rayner, 1998). This view
also construes these processes as distinct from prediction, and therefore
predicts dissociable frequency effects from predictability effects.
In contrast, an inferential view (e.g. surprisal theory; Hale, 2001;
Levy, 2008) emphasizes the probabilistic inference over possible
structure- or message-level analyses given the partial sentence, and
posits that the contextual predictability of a word determines its
processing difficulty. According to this view, frequency effects should
be subsumed by predictability effects, because more frequent words
are also more predictable than less frequent words in unconstrained
contexts (i.e. they have higher prior probabilities).
Modeling studies that aim to answer this question using naturalistic reading times have yielded mixed results. For example, Goodkind and Bicknell (2021) analyzed fixation durations in the Dundee
dataset (Kennedy, Hill, & Pynte, 2003) and found dissociable frequency
effects from predictability effects that were operationalized by 𝑛-gram
language models. This is in contrast to the earlier work by Shain (2019),
who found that word frequency did not improve fit to unseen data on
the Dundee, Natural Stories (Futrell et al., 2021), and UCL (Frank, Monsalve, Thompson, & Vigliocco, 2013) datasets over a baseline including
5-gram surprisal. In light of these conflicting findings, Shain (2024)
revisited this question at scale with more reading time datasets and a
more flexible modeling approach that relaxes assumptions that are inappropriate for modeling naturalistic reading. Using surprisal estimates
from the GPT-2 language model (Radford et al., 2019) to operationalize
predictability, Shain (2024) found a dissociable frequency effect on
most datasets, which is consistent with the predictions of the procedural
view.
While Shain (2024) acknowledges that model size has an impact on
the quality of surprisal estimates as predictors of reading times (based
on results in e.g. Oh, Clark, & Schuler, 2022; Shain et al., 2024), the
potential influence of training data amount was not considered. More
importantly, word frequency was found to modulate the influence of

Experiment 1: Effects of LLM size and training data amount on
frequency effects
The first experiment evaluates the ability of word frequency to
predict naturalistic reading times in the presence of surprisal estimates
from LLMs that systematically vary in model size and training data
amount. To this end, a series of CDR-NN (Shain, 2021; Shain & Schuler,
2024) models was fit and evaluated.
Methods
Response data
This experiment used reading times from five self-paced reading
(SPR) and eye-tracking (ET) corpora, which are the Brown and Natural
Stories SPR corpora (Futrell et al., 2021; Smith & Levy, 2013) and
the GECO, Dundee, and Provo ET corpora (Cop, Dirix, Drieghe, &
Duyck, 2017; Kennedy et al., 2003; Luke & Christianson, 2018). Data
preprocessing and modeling procedures closely follow those of Shain
(2024), which are described below.
For the SPR datasets, the by-word reading times (i.e. the time taken
between keystrokes to advance to the next word) provided the response
variables. Data points were filtered to exclude those of sentence-initial
and -final words and those shorter than 100 ms or longer than 3000 ms.
For the ET datasets, as eye movements recorded through eye-tracking
are non-linear, the following by-word measures were analyzed.

• Scan path duration: Time taken between entering a word region
(from the left or right) and entering a different word region (to the
left or right). Unlike total fixation duration, this treats rereading
of the same word as a different event from its first reading.
• First-pass duration: Time elapsed between entering a word region
from the left in the first pass and entering a different word region
(to the left or right).
• Go-past duration: Time elapsed between entering a word region
from the left and entering a word region to the right (including
all regressive fixations).

Hyperparameters and model sizes of Pythia LLM variants whose surprisal estimates
were used in this experiment. #L, #H, and 𝑑model refer to number of layers, number
of attention heads per layer, and embedding size, respectively.

The response reading times were filtered to remove those for unfixated words, fixations interrupted by blinks, words following saccades
longer than 20 words, and words at starts and ends of sentences and
documents. For the Dundee Corpus (Kennedy et al., 2003) that further
provides annotations of positions within lines and screens, response
reading times of words at starts and ends of lines and screens were
also removed.
Prior to regression modeling, all datasets were split into fit, exploratory, and held-out partitions roughly consisting of 50%, 25%, and
25% of data points respectively. This partitioning was conducted based
on the sum of the subject index and the sentence index,2 meaning that
all data points from a subject reading a particular sentence was kept
intact in one partition. The fit partition was used to fit the regression
models, and the exploratory partition was used to diagnose convergence and inform early stopping. Model comparison and statistical
significance tests were conducted on the held-out partition.

Provo ET. The Provo Corpus (Luke & Christianson, 2018) contains eyetracking data from 84 subjects that read 55 short English passages
consisting of a total of 2746 words that range from news articles,
science magazines, and works of fiction. The partitioning and filtering
procedures resulted in 72,801, 36,633, and 36,397 scan path durations,
as well as 50,534, 25,349, and 25,406 first-pass and go-past durations
in the fit, exploratory, and held-out partitions respectively.
Predictors
Surprisal predictors. As a measure of word frequency, unigram surprisal was estimated using the OpenWebText Corpus (Gokaslan & Cohen, 2019), which is a replication of GPT-2’s (Radford et al., 2019)
WebText training corpus and contains about 6.5 billion words. Unigram probabilities were estimated using the KenLM toolkit (Heafield,
Pouzyrevsky, Clark, & Koehn, 2013) and its interpolation protocols
for out-of-vocabulary words, which were subsequently converted to
surprisal scale.
The unigram surprisal predictor was evaluated in the presence of
surprisal estimates from Pythia LLMs (Biderman et al., 2023) that differ
in model size and training data amount. Pythia LLMs are decoder-only
autoregressive Transformer-based models whose variants differ primarily in their model size. The relevant hyperparameters and resulting
model sizes of the Pythia variants are outlined in Table 1.
Importantly for this experiment, all eight Pythia variants were
trained using identical batches of training examples that were presented
in the same order. These training examples are from the Pile (Gao et al.,
2020), which is a collection of English language datasets that consists of
around 300 billion tokens. A total of 143,000 batches of 1024 examples
with 2048 tokens (i.e. 2,097,152 tokens in each batch) was used to train
the eight variants, which amounts to about one epoch over the entire
Pile dataset. Model parameters that were saved during early training
stages (i.e. after 1, 2, 4, . . . , 256, 512 batches) as well as after every
1000 batches are publicly available.4 Surprisal estimates from the eight
variants after {256, 512, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 143 000} training
batches were used in this experiment for computational efficiency of
regression modeling. These steps were chosen based on earlier results
that show a peak in fit to human reading times at around 1000 training
batches, and relatively little change after batch 8000 onwards for the
Natural Stories and Dundee datasets (Oh & Schuler, 2023a).
Each article or story of the reading time corpora was tokenized by
Pythia’s byte-pair encoding (BPE; Sennrich, Haddow, & Birch, 2016)
tokenizer and provided as input to each model variant. When a word
𝑤𝑡 was tokenized into multiple tokens, negative log probabilities of
subword tokens corresponding to 𝑤𝑡 were summed to calculate 𝖲(𝑤𝑡 ) =
− log 𝖯(𝑤𝑡 ∣ 𝑤1..𝑡−1 ) according to the chain rule of conditional probabilities.5 In cases where each story or article was longer than a single
context window of 2048 tokens, surprisal estimates for the remaining
tokens were calculated by using the second half of the previous context
window as the first half of a new context window.

Brown SPR. The Brown SPR Corpus (Smith & Levy, 2013) contains
reading times from 35 subjects that read 13 English passages from the
Brown Corpus (Kučera & Francis, 1967) that consist of a total of 7188
words. The partitioning and filtering procedures resulted in 59,617,
29,693, and 29,810 data points in the fit, exploratory, and held-out
partitions respectively.
Natural Stories SPR. The Natural Stories Corpus (Futrell et al., 2021)
contains reading times from 181 subjects that read 10 naturalistic
English stories consisting of 10,256 words. Data points were further
filtered to remove those from subjects who answered fewer than four
comprehension questions correctly. The partitioning and filtering procedures resulted in 386,249, 192,455, and 190,475 data points in the
fit, exploratory, and held-out partitions respectively.
GECO ET. The Ghent Eye-Tracking Corpus (GECO; Cop et al., 2017)
contains eye-tracking data from 14 monolingual subjects that read the
English version of the novel The Mysterious Affair at Styles (Agatha
Christie, 1920), which consists of 13 chapters and 56,441 words. The
partitioning and filtering procedures resulted in 149,392, 74,846, and
74,532 first-pass and go-past durations3 in the fit, exploratory, and
held-out partitions respectively.
Dundee ET. The Dundee Corpus (Kennedy et al., 2003) contains eyetracking data from 10 subjects that read 67 English newspaper editorials consisting of a total of 51,501 words. The partitioning and
filtering procedures resulted in 126,970, 63,469, and 63,580 scan path
durations, as well as 96,661, 48,196, and 48,276 first-pass and go-past
durations in the fit, exploratory, and held-out partitions respectively.

If this value modulo four is zero or one, the data point was assigned to
the fit partition; if this value modulo four is two, the data point was assigned
to the exploratory partition; if this value modulo four is three, the data point
was assigned to the held-out partition.
3
The scan path durations could not be calculated as the GECO dataset does
not provide raw fixation durations.

To our knowledge, this makes Pythia models the most comprehensive in
terms of model size and training data amount, which motivates their use in
this experiment.

Baseline predictors. In addition to the surprisal predictors, the following
set of baseline predictors was also included in all regression models.

Results
First, we present how well surprisal from each LLM variant predicts
the reading times from the 10 datasets in aggregate over just the
baseline predictors, as a measure of how strong they are as predictors
of comprehension difficulty. Fig. 1 generally replicates previous results
using linear mixed-effects modeling that show a ‘peak’ at around 1000
training batches (the 70M variant) and an adverse effect of model size
by the end of training (Oh & Schuler, 2023a).
On top of these surprisal predictors, the ability of word frequency
to predict naturalistic reading times decreases as the LLMs used to
generate surprisal are trained on fewer data (Fig. 2). The slope of the
best-fitting line between log number of training batches and 𝛥LL due to
unigram surprisal is greater than zero on all 10 datasets, eight of which
obtain statistical significance by a permutation test that permutes the
independent variable. This overall trend is highly significant by a
binomial test (8 out of 10 successes; 𝑝 < 0.001). The lack of significance
on the Brown and Natural Stories SPR datasets is likely due to the
high variance in held-out log-likelihood between training runs (see e.g.
Shain et al., 2024), which itself may be due to the smaller number
of predictors compared to ET datasets for a highly flexible model like
CDR-NN.
The same data visualized as a function of model size (Fig. 3)
reveals a similar trend, where 𝛥LL due to unigram surprisal decreases
as smaller LLMs are used to calculate surprisal. Again, the slope of
the best-fitting line between log number of parameters and 𝛥LL is
greater than zero on all 10 datasets, seven of which obtain statistical
significance by a permutation test. This overall trend is again highly
significant by a binomial test (7 out of 10 successes; 𝑝 < 0.001). These
results indicate that frequency compensates for surprisal less and less
as smaller LLMs trained on fewer data are used to calculate surprisal.
Together with the results in Fig. 1, this shows that generally speaking,
word frequency plays a smaller role in accounting for processing difficulty in the presence of surprisal estimates that approximate human
reading times more closely.

• Rate: The ‘‘deconvolutional intercept’’ that depends solely on
stimulus timing regardless of the properties of a word (Shain &
Schuler, 2021).
• Word length: Length of the word in characters.
• End of sentence: Whether the word ends a sentence, which is
designed to capture lingering effects of sentence boundaries.
For the models fit to ET datasets, the following modality-specific baseline predictors were also included.
• Saccade length: Length of the incoming saccade in words.
• Regression: Whether the fixation follows a regressive saccade.
For models fit to the Dundee ET dataset that provides annotations
of screen and line boundaries, the following baseline predictors were
included for similar reasons as the ‘end of sentence’ predictor above.
• End of line: Whether the word ends a line.
• End of screen: Whether the word ends a screen.
Regression modeling
This experiment fit a series of CDR-NN models to evaluate the
contribution of word frequency over predictability. Following Shain
(2024), the CDR-NN models estimated the parameters of an exGaussian distribution, which is the convolution of a Gaussian distribution
(with location 𝜇 and dispersion 𝜎 parameters) with an exponential
distribution (with a skewness 𝜏 parameter). The exGaussian distribution
has been used in previous work to study the distributional influence
of word frequency and predictability on reading times (Staub, 2010,
2011). To assess the contribution of frequency over predictability, two
sets of CDR-NN models were fit to reading times in the fit partition
of each corpus. The ‘full’ models are CDR-NN models that include
both unigram surprisal and LLM surprisal as described in Section
‘‘Predictors’’, and their corresponding ‘ablated’ models are those that
ablate the unigram surprisal predictor. All models include maximal
by-subject random intercepts, slopes, and neural network parameters,
as well as random intercepts for each word position in each text.
Convergence is diagnosed based on a time-loss correlation criterion on
the exploratory partition, where the correlation between training epoch
number and likelihood every 10 epochs is calculated over a window
of 250 consecutive epochs (Shain & Schuler, 2021). More specifically,
models are considered to be converged whenever likelihood on the
exploratory partition is statistically non-increasing at 𝛼 = 0.5 for at
least 13 of the preceding 25 evaluations.
After the CDR-NN models have converged, the change in conditional
log-likelihood (𝛥LL) on the held-out partition of each corpus was
calculated between a full model and its counterpart ablated model.
To minimize variation due to stochastic optimization, the change in
log-likelihood was calculated based on ensembles of 10 training runs;
the median held-out log-likelihood of 10 runs of an ablated model was
subtracted from that of 10 runs of a full model to calculate 𝛥LL.

Discussion
Through the first experiment, we provide evidence that the ability
of frequency to predict naturalistic reading times over and above predictability depends on the model size and training data amount of the
LLM used to calculate surprisal. More specifically, frequency becomes
less predictive of reading times when the underlying LLM is smaller,
trained on fewer data, and provides a better surprisal predictor. This
confirms the strong relationship between LLM surprisal and frequency
that is modulated by model size and training data amount (Oh et al.,
2024), and indicates that limitations in these two variables result in
surprisal estimates that are more consistent with the inferential view
of frequency effects (i.e. frequency effects as a by-product of predictive
processing). The finding that surprisal from smaller models trained
on fewer data is generally more predictive of reading times (Fig. 1,
but also Oh & Schuler, 2023b; Shain et al., 2024) further suggests
that Shain’s (2024) estimates of frequency effects on top of surprisal
from the GPT-2 model (Radford et al., 2019) may be systematically
overestimated.
It should be noted that the results of this experiment are based
on surprisal from Pythia models, which have a specific Transformerbased architecture and a specific training dataset. As a consequence,
while these results may not generalize to other models, this serves as
a proof of concept that different conclusions about the dissociability of
frequency effects from predictability effects could be drawn depending
on the underlying LLM, and that there are reasons to be cautious
of Shain’s (2024) conclusions. An active line of research in both language modeling and computational psycholinguistics involves studying
how the architectural properties of a neural network influence the
learned probabilities (Bietti, Cabannes, Bouchacourt, Jegou, & Bottou,

5
Concurrent work (Oh & Schuler, 2024b; Pimentel & Meister, 2024)
has shown that this method of aggregating subword probabilities results in
incorrect word probabilities if the tokens have leading whitespaces like those
in Pythia’s vocabulary. Follow-up analysis with corrected surprisal from LLM
variants showed that the numerical difference in regression model likelihood
is not large, and therefore we conclude that this would not drastically change
the results of this experiment.

measures of processing difficulty (Clark, Oh, & Schuler, 2025; de Varda
& Marelli, 2024), which indicates that exploring additional language
models that capture human-like predictive processing remains as an
open agenda. Therefore, we refrain from adjudicating the underlying
relationship between frequency and predictability effects based on
these results, but rather emphasize declining effects of frequency as
LLM-based predictors improve and the possibility of dissociable frequency effects disappearing entirely as better-fitting language models
are discovered.

durations were processed to calculate the scan path, first-pass, and
go-past durations for each word region. Subsequently, the data were
filtered to remove those for unfixated words, words following saccades
longer than four words, and words at starts and ends of sentences,
lines, and documents. Additionally, data from subjects that answered
fewer than two out of four article-level comprehension questions correctly were excluded from analysis. The data were then split into fit,
exploratory, and held-out partitions roughly consisting of 50%, 25%,
and 25% of data points respectively, following the same procedures as
Experiment 1. The fit partition was used to fit the regression models,
and all results are reported on the exploratory partition. The final
number of observations in each partition of MECO is outlined in Table
2.

Experiment 2: Effects of LLM size replicated on multilingual
datasets
The previous experiment revealed a strong influence that the model
size of LLMs used for surprisal calculation has on the ability of word
frequency to predict naturalistic reading times. However, as the experiment relies solely on LLMs trained on English text and data from native
speakers of English, it remains to be seen whether the results generalize
to data from other languages. To this end, the second experiment
evaluates the influence of LLM size on word frequency’s fit to reading
times in a multilingual eye-tracking dataset using linear mixed-effects
regression models.

Predictors
Surprisal predictors. As a measure of word frequency, unigram surprisal
was calculated using the wordfreq toolkit (Robyn Speer, 2022),
which is based on word counts from corpora that span multiple genres.
This unigram surprisal predictor was evaluated in the presence of surprisal estimates from publicly available LLMs trained on each language
covered by MECO. For comparability with Experiment 1, decoder-only
autoregressive Transformer-based models that had multiple variants of
different sizes were chosen for analysis.7 Whenever available, LLMs
trained only on data in the language of interest (i.e. ‘monolingual’
models) were chosen. For languages in which such models were not
available, the ‘multilingual’ mGPT models (Shliazhko et al., 2024) were
used to calculate surprisal estimates.8 The relevant hyperparameters
and model sizes of each LLM variant are outlined in Table 3.

Methods
Response data
This experiment used reading times from the Multilingual EyeMovement Corpus (MECO; Siegelman et al., 2022), which contains
eye-tracking data collected in 13 languages.6 The data were collected
from 29–54 subjects (depending on language) that read a total of
12 Wikipedia-style entries covering a variety of topics, which were
chosen to minimize the potential influence of academic knowledge or
cultural bias across collection sites. As in Experiment 1, these fixation

Unlike the English Pythia models, none of the other languages in MECO
had publicly available LLMs that vary systematically in the amount of their
training data.
8
As all of these models have leading whitespaces in their subword tokens,
correction to their word probabilities (Oh & Schuler, 2024b; Pimentel &
Meister, 2024) was applied prior to surprisal calculation.

We exclude the Estonian data from our analysis, as there were no publicly
available estimates of word frequency.

dissociability of frequency and predictability effects depends on the
LLM used to calculate surprisal estimates.

Results

Discussion

Again, we first present how well surprisal from each LLM variant
predicts the reading times in each language subset over just the baseline
predictors, as a measure of how strong they are as predictors of reading
times. Fig. 4 replicates the adverse effect of model size on surprisal’s
fit to reading times strictly in 9 out of 12 languages (all except Dutch,
English, and Korean), which is consistent with both Experiment 1 and
previous work (Oh & Schuler, 2023b; Shain et al., 2024).
The results in Fig. 5 show that the trend observed in Experiment 1
is replicated in 11 out of 12 languages (all except Korean), where 𝛥LL
due to unigram surprisal strictly increases as bigger LLMs are used to
calculate surprisal. While both the number of reading time data points
and the number of LLM variants are much smaller than in Experiment 1,

The second experiment provides additional evidence that the ability
of frequency to predict reading times over and above predictability
depends on the model size of the LLM used to calculate surprisal. The
finding that the influence of model size replicates on 11 out of 12 languages examined further attests to the close relationship between LLM
surprisal and frequency, and suggests that this is a general property of

training data amount may also replicate on reading time data across a
wide range of languages.
One language subset that does not show this trend is Korean, despite
the availability of monolingual LLMs that span a wider range of parameter count. A possible explanation for this is the incorrect tokenization
of Korean words observed occasionally throughout the MECO dataset;
the dataset treats some Korean words as consisting of multiple word

regions, and therefore these words are incorrectly tokenized in the
text stimuli.10 This is likely to have resulted in incorrect estimates
of both word frequency and surprisal that confound the experimental

results, with a potentially larger influence on surprisal due to the LLMs’
dependence on previous incorrectly tokenized input.

Results
Fig. 6 shows a clear interaction between token frequency, model
size, and training data amount. The subset of most frequent tokens
(top right panel) seem to be ‘learned’ early, with average surprisal
dropping greatly with only 128 training batches. Moreover, after about
4000 training batches, additional training data does not seem to further
improve the predictions of these tokens. On the other hand, the prediction of the least frequent tokens (bottom right panel) continue to be
learned throughout the end of training, with the larger models showing
a decrease in average surprisal between 64,000 and 143,000 training
batches. In contrast, the smaller models do not seem to be able to
learn to predict these tokens, even with large amounts of training data.
The intermediate quintiles further support this general trend, with the
difference in average surprisal as a function of model size and training
data amount gradually increasing as token frequency decreases. These
trends suggest that it is the systematically lower surprisal assigned
to low-frequency words that drives the effects observed in the two
experiments.

Follow-up analyses: Learning trajectories of low-frequency tokens
The two experiments revealed that as the LLMs for calculating
surprisal become bigger and are trained on more data, the ability
of word frequency to predict reading times reliably increases. This
indicates that frequency compensates for surprisal either because bigger LLMs trained on more data systematically assign higher surprisal
to high-frequency words or because they systematically assign lower
surprisal to low-frequency words. Using the same corpora and LLMs
as in Experiment 1, these follow-up analyses first establish that it is
the latter of the two cases that primarily drives the effects of model
size and training data amount. Subsequently, low-frequency tokens are
further categorized into patterns that are informed by properties of the
Transformer architecture or standard language modeling practices to
study the impact of the two variables on token-level probabilities.

Analysis 2: Increase in model size helps LLMs form specific associations
Methods
These results on low-frequency tokens pose additional questions
about why limitations in model size appear to pose a bottleneck for
learning to predict low-frequency tokens in spite of large amounts of
training data. To answer these questions, low-frequency tokens were
further categorized by properties that are informed by the inductive
biases of the Transformer architecture or standard language modeling
practices.
In these examples, 𝑥 denotes each subword token, and the language
model uses the left context 𝑥1..𝑖−1 to predict 𝑥𝑖 .

Analysis 1: The effects are driven by systematically lower surprisal assigned
to low-frequency words
Methods
The tokens in the five reading time corpora used in Experiment
1 were first divided into quintiles defined by token-level unigram
surprisal estimated from the training data of the Pythia LLMs (Gao
et al., 2020).11 More specifically, counts from tokens in 16,000 training batches (∼33 billion tokens of the Pile) were used to estimate
token-level unigram probabilities over the vocabulary of the Pythia
LLMs. Preliminary analyses showed that these ∼33 billion tokens were
enough to reliably estimate probabilities over 50,277 token types in
the vocabulary. The average token-level surprisal on each quintile was
then calculated using Pythia variants at various points throughout their
training.

• Repeated tokens: Tokens 𝑥𝑖 that have been observed in the context, i.e. 𝑥𝑘 = 𝑥𝑖 for some 𝑘 < 𝑖. The Transformer architecture has
access to veridical representations of the input sequence, unlike
the class of recurrent neural networks that maintain and update a
representation of fixed size. This property allows Transformers to
reliably repeat input tokens that have been observed earlier in the
sequence in comparison to architectures based on recurrence (Jelassi et al., 2024). The complement of this set is referred to as
non-repeated tokens (i.e. tokens that are not part of the current
input sequence).

11
Note that this is different from the word-level unigram surprisal that was
used as a predictor of reading times in Experiment 1.

Fig. 6. Average token-level surprisal values from Pythia LLM variants aggregated across all reading time corpora (top left), and those by quintiles defined by token-level unigram
surprisal. The titles of subplots denote the interval of each quintile.

• Induction tokens: Tokens 𝑥𝑖 that together with its preceding token
𝑥𝑖−1 have been observed in the context, i.e. 𝑥𝑘 = 𝑥𝑖 and 𝑥𝑘−1 =
𝑥𝑖−1 for some 𝑘 < 𝑖. This is a subset of repeated tokens that are
thought to be easier to predict due to the observation of 𝑥𝑖−1 ,
which triggers the model to ‘look back’ at 𝑥𝑘−1 and ‘copy over’
𝑥𝑘 to predict 𝑥𝑖 (Bietti et al., 2023; Olsson et al., 2022).
• Word-internal tokens: Tokens 𝑥𝑖 like er that are ‘inside’ of words
like miller. Most contemporary LLMs use subword tokenization
schemes to define their vocabulary, which allows arbitrary words
to be handled by the model while keeping the vocabulary size
tractable. This results in whitespace-delimited words that are
tokenized into multiple tokens; word-internal tokens refer to those
that are ‘inside’ whitespace-delimited words and include punctuation marks like commas and full stops. These tokens are likely
to be predictable from the earlier subword token(s) of the same
word.

The relationship between these categories is visualized in Fig. 7. Subsequently, the learning trajectories of subsets defined by these categories
were analyzed to examine where the increase in model size and training
data amount has the biggest influence on their accurate prediction.
Results
The results in Fig. 8 show that different subsets of tokens are learned
at different points in training. Until Batch 512, all models seem to
mainly learn to predict word-internal tokens that have not been seen
in the context (Condition 1), where the largest decrease in average
surprisal is observed. Subsequently, from Batch 512 to Batch 1000,
a steep decrease in average surprisal occurs for word-internal tokens
that are repeated from the input (Conditions 2 and 3). Across all
models, there is very little change in average surprisal after this point,
which indicates that these tokens are learned the earliest. From Batch

rare tokens and better fits to reading times compared to larger models.
Such tokens are likely to correspond to subsets of words that embody
factual knowledge like named entity nouns, of which bigger LLMs have
been shown to make ‘superhuman’ predictions (Oh & Schuler, 2023b).
General discussion
While surprisal from Transformer-based LLMs is often used in
psycholinguistic modeling work as predictors that operationalize predictability, factors like their number of parameters or amount of
training data have a substantial influence on their fit to human reading
times (Oh & Schuler, 2023a; Shain et al., 2024). Different sensitivity
to word frequency has been proposed as an explanation for these
trends (Oh et al., 2024), which has direct implications for using them
to study the dissociability of frequency effects from predictability
effects (Goodkind & Bicknell, 2021; Shain, 2019, 2024). This article
illustrates this point through regression analyses using naturalistic
reading time datasets spanning multiple genres and languages. The
results show robust positive effects of LLM size and training data
amount on the ability of word frequency to predict human reading
times, which indicates that frequency predictors are compensating for
surprisal predictors, and that this compensation decreases as LLM size
and training data amount decrease and the fit of surprisal to reading
times improves.
This may apply not only to the specific class of Transformer-based
LLMs with different model sizes and training data amounts that were
examined in this study, but more broadly to other language models
with different prediction objectives (Arehalli, Dillon, & Linzen, 2022;
Hale et al., 2018), neural network architectures (Merkx & Frank, 2021;
Michaelov, Arnett, & Bergen, 2024; Wilcox et al., 2020), granularity
of text prediction (Nair & Resnik, 2023; Oh, Clark, & Schuler, 2021;
Oh & Schuler, 2024a), etc. With still largely open questions about
modeling human-like predictive processing, drawing conclusions based
on predictors from one particular computational model may be hasty.
The finding that estimated frequency effects get larger in the presence
of surprisal from LLMs that are bigger and trained on more data – which
themselves are poorer predictors of reading times – raises the concern
that the observed frequency effects may be due to imperfect estimates
of predictability. As better-fitting language models are discovered by
psycholinguists, dissociable frequency effects may disappear entirely.
In conjunction with exploring additional language models, efforts
toward understanding their predictive mechanisms better are also required in order to make more precise claims about human sentence
processing. An inherent shortcoming of studies using neural networks
like LLMs to model human sentence processing is that it is difficult to
explicate how the current state of the language processor influences
the processing difficulty of the observed word. This is primarily because
neural networks perform complex computations over continuous vector
representations of each word, the dimensions of which are not directly
interpretable in terms of e.g. linguistic abstractions. Therefore, studying
the information encoded in the representations of these LLMs and
how it influences their predictions (for overviews, see Belinkov, 2022;
Linzen & Baroni, 2021; Rogers, Kovaleva, & Rumshisky, 2020) is important for characterizing their predictive mechanisms and appreciating
them as models of human sentence processing.
In this spirit, the subsequent follow-up analyses examined how the
increase in model size helps the prediction of low-frequency tokens.
The Transformer architecture has veridical access to the input, which
allows Transformer-based models to readily repeat sub-sequences from
it. Additionally, the contemporary standard practice of using subword
tokenizers results in highly constraining contexts such as ‘insides’ of
long words, where the subsequent tokens are highly predictable given
the first. An analysis of the learning trajectories of tokens categorized
according to these properties showed that the influence of model size
is strongest on tokens that are not part of a bigram sequence observed
earlier in the context. As these tokens cannot be predicted by simply

1000 to 2000, models appear to learn to predict repeated non-wordinternal tokens (Conditions 4 and 5). Generally, tokens that follow the
induction pattern (Conditions 3 and 4) are learned to be predicted more
accurately, as can be seen by their lower average surprisal compared
to their non-induction counterparts (Conditions 2 and 5) by the end
of training. Finally, non-repeated non-word-internal tokens (Condition
6) seem to be learned most slowly and predicted least accurately,
with average surprisal gradually decreasing throughout the course of
training. By the end of training, tokens in Conditions 5 and 6 appear to
show the biggest difference in average surprisal as a function of model
size. These tokens are not part of a bigram sequence observed earlier in
the context (i.e. non-repeated tokens, or repeated tokens in a different
bigram context) in usually non-constraining contexts (cf. word-internal
tokens).
Discussion
The follow-up analyses provide insight into the reasons underlying
the trends observed in the two experiments. As a predictor of reading
times, frequency appears to systematically compensate for lower surprisal assigned to low-frequency words, thereby achieving stronger fit
in the presence of surprisal from bigger LLMs trained on more data.
This is consistent with previous results showing that the adverse effects
of model size and training data amount on surprisal’s fit to reading
times are driven by more severe mispredictions of reading times at
low-frequency words (Oh et al., 2024). Additionally, this confirms the
importance of training example frequency on LLMs’ learned probabilities (Tirumala, Markosyan, Zettlemoyer, & Aghajanyan, 2022; Xia et al.,
2023), and aligns with previous findings that neural language models
first approximate unigram probabilities and then higher-order 𝑛-gram
probabilities (Chang & Bergen, 2022; Chang, Tu, & Bergen, 2023)
throughout training. Importantly for psycholinguistic modeling, model
size and training data amount appear to shape predictability estimates
from LLMs in a way that is relevant to extant research questions.
The second analysis delved more specifically into the predictive
mechanisms that allow bigger LLMs to predict low-frequency tokens
more accurately than their smaller counterparts. The learning trajectories of low-frequency tokens revealed that the influence of model size is
strongest on tokens that are not repeated in the input, or are repeated
in a different bigram context. To predict these tokens, models cannot
simply copy observed bigrams, but rather must rely on information
encoded in their parameters. If Transformer-based LLMs are viewed as
associative memories between tokens (Bietti et al., 2023), this suggests
that the limitations in model size create pressures toward learning more
general associations, thereby resulting in less accurate predictions of

copying, this may be best explained from an associative-memory view
of Transformers (Bietti et al., 2023); the limitations in the number
of model parameters may enforce more general associations between
tokens during training, which results in less accurate predictions of rare
words and better fits to reading times.
These results suggest that more specific associations obtained from
the training data make bigger LLMs less susceptible to incorrectly
predicting low-frequency words compared to their smaller counterparts. Given that these models are trained on vast amounts of Internet
text, this kind of association might correspond to factual knowledge
that enables naturalistic text stimuli to be readily predicted. While
such knowledge is an important determinant of an individual’s reading behavior (Škrjanec, Broy, & Demberg, 2023; Smith, Snow, Serry,
& Hammond, 2021) and that of their frequency effects (Monaghan,
Chang, Welbourne, & Brysbaert, 2017), the knowledge embodied by
LLMs is likely to be ‘superhuman’ compared to that of typical human

readers (Oh & Schuler, 2023b). In this regard, applying model editing
techniques (Meng, Bau, Andonian, & Belinkov, 2022; Wang et al., 2023)
to tone down such knowledge in LLMs may be a promising direction for
estimates of predictability that better align with measures of processing
difficulty.
This is complementary to the perfect memory of the inference-time
context (i.e. veridical access to the input) that is often considered to
be problematic of LLMs under the framework of lossy-context surprisal (Futrell, Gibson, & Levy, 2020; Hahn, Futrell, Gibson, & Levy,
2022). The learning trajectories of low-frequency tokens show that
models learn to accurately predict tokens that have been observed in
the input regardless of size, indicating that they learn to implement
a kind of copying mechanism that leverages their veridical access to
the input (Elhage et al., 2021; Jelassi et al., 2024). This has been
shown to cause a severe misalignment in modeling the processing
behavior of repeated text (Gruteke Klein, Meiri, Shubi, & Berzak, 2024;

for human-like estimates of predictability. Explicitly implementing a
form of decay to limit the models’ access to earlier material in the
input (Clark et al., 2025; de Varda & Marelli, 2024; Hahn et al., 2022)
may alleviate this issue.
Finally, the fundamental source of LLM surprisal’s sensitivity to
frequency is likely to be the LLMs’ training objective of lexical nextword prediction, which suggests another direction for improving LLMs
as models of human sentence processing. That is, the training signal
rewards only the correct prediction of the specific lexical form, which
means that any linguistic abstraction has to be indirectly learned from
distributional evidence. In contrast, humans make broader predictions
based on linguistic abstractions such as semantic features, which have
generally shown separable effects from the prediction of specific lexical
forms during real-time processing (Federmeier & Kutas, 1999; Roland,
Yun, Koenig, & Mauner, 2012). To close this gap, more models that
make explicit predictions about linguistic abstractions (e.g. Oh et al.,
2022) should be trained and evaluated against human subject data.

Limitations
There are methodological choices adopted in this study that may
limit the generalizability of the results. First, this study relies on reading
time data of naturalistic text stimuli, which does not experimentally
manipulate frequency and predictability. While the naturalistic reading
paradigm may obtain higher ecological validity than controlled experiments, there may be confounding variables that are not controlled
for by our regression modeling. Moreover, due to the partitioning
protocols, both the CDR-NN and LME models are evaluated in terms
of generalization likelihood across sentences for a given subject, but
not across subjects. Future work could explore the generalizability of
these results across subjects or datasets using different random effects
structures.
In terms of the predictors, our experiments used token frequency
as the measure of word frequency, when lemma frequency may reflect the ease of lexical access more accurately. However, estimates of
lemma frequency are usually not available at scale, which limits their
applicability to naturalistic corpora. Finally, the training data amounts
of the Pythia LLMs used in Experiment 1 are potentially confounded
by their learning rate schedule, which backpropagates the error from
each training batch with different learning rates. As such, the different
amounts of training data should be interpreted as lying on a continuum,
with each training batch having a different degree of influence on the
LLMs’ learned probabilities.
