Introduction
Producing language involves generating temporally or spatially
linear sequences of sounds or symbols, which are the products of piecing
together smaller units to form bigger units; from morphemes to words,
from words to phrases, and from phrases to sentences. These linguistic
units are organized in a hierarchical manner, as the functions and
meanings of the units are determined by the process of integrating units
that are not necessarily adjacent to one another. As such, the same linear
sequence of linguistic units can be structured in different ways, and the
message or interpretation could differ depending on the specific struc­
ture one commits to. For example, in sentences such as “I met the stu­
dents of the teacher who played the violin”, the relative clause “who
played the violin” can either have a high attachment (HA) configuration,
which means “the students” played the violin, or a low attachment (LA)
configuration, which means “the teacher” played the violin. Similarly, in
noun phrases such as “social psychologist”, the morpheme “-ist” can
either attach high to “social psycholog(y)” to mean someone who studies

the discipline of social psychology, or attach low to “psycholog(y)” only
to mean someone who studies psychology and enjoys the companion­
ship of others. Despite the difference in the grain size of the linguistic
units involved, these examples illustrate that words and sentences are at
least abstractly similar in their internal structures, in that processing
words and sentences both require combining hierarchically organized
units. That leads to the question: Are the cognitive mechanisms that
process the internal structures of words and sentences shared? Here we
first introduce paradigms in structural priming, which have been
commonly used to test whether two superficially distinct forms of
structures share the same underlying representation or operation. Then,
we review previous work on cross-domain and linguistic priming.
Speakers can often choose between multiple structures to convey a
similar message, but studies have shown that they are more likely to
repeat a sentence structure that they have recently been exposed to (say,
in the preceding sentence) than to produce an alternative structure that
conveys a similar meaning, even if the priming and the primed material
are not conceptually related. This phenomenon of abstract structure

reuse is one form of structural priming. For example, in a picture
description task, Bock (1986) found that after participants heard and
repeated out loud a passive voice prime sentence (e.g., “The referee was
punched by one of the fans”), as opposed to an active voice prime sen­
tence (e.g., “One of the fans punched the referee”), they were more likely
to subsequently describe an unrelated target picture in passive voice (e.
g., “The church is being struck by lightning”). Similar patterns were also
found for other structures, such as between producing a prepositional
dative (e.g., “The rock star sold some cocaine to the undercover agent”)
or a double object dative sentence (e.g., “A rock star sold the undercover
agent some cocaine”; see Bock, 1986, 1989, and Bock & Loebell, 1990);
and between completing the relative clause sentence fragment “The
pensioner railed about the author of the fliers that…” with an HA
(describing the author) versus LA continuation (describing the fliers;
Scheepers, 2003).
Structural priming has also been observed in comprehension (see
Tooley & Traxler, 2010 for a review). For example, Pickering et al.
(2013) used a sentence-picture matching task to observe priming in the
interpretation of sentences with ambiguous prepositional phrase
attachment such as “The waitress is prodding the clown with the um­
brella,” with either the HA interpretation (i.e., the waitress is using the
umbrella to prod) or the LA interpretation (i.e., the clown has an um­
brella). They manipulated the attachment interpretation of prime sen­
tences by asking participants to select a picture that matched a prime
sentence, with only one picture matching either the HA or LA inter­
pretation of the prime sentence. In the target items, participants per­
formed the same task again, except that they picked between a picture
depicting the HA interpretation and another depicting the LA interpre­
tation instead. Results showed that after reading a sentence with a
particular attachment interpretation, comprehenders were more likely
to interpret the following sentence the same way.
Patterns of structural priming have been replicated regardless of
whether participants were exposed to the primes through reading and
repeating (Bock, 1986), reading and picture-matching (Pickering et al.,
2013), writing (Pickering & Branigan, 1998), typing (Corley &
Scheepers, 2002), or listening to another interlocutor in dialogue
(Branigan et al., 2000). Indeed, Tooley’s (2023) review contrasting
structural priming effects in production and comprehension concluded
that abstract structural priming occurs in both modalities. Differences
that are sometimes observed between production and comprehension
studies likely reflect differences in dependent variables and tasks, rather
than speakers and comprehenders engaging different modality-specific
cognitive mechanisms. Priming is also observed between modalities,
that is, from comprehension to production (Bock et al., 2007) and from
production to comprehension (Ferreira et al., 2012). That is, structuring
operations in language appear to be modality-independent. Generally,
the aforementioned studies suggest that structural priming occurs
because the representation of the abstract sentence structure in use re­
mains accessible for some time, making that template more likely to be
reused compared to its alternatives (see Pickering & Ferreira, 2008 for a
review on structural priming and its implications for models of language
processing). Thus, when structural priming occurs between two lin­
guistic units that are seemingly different on the surface, the units are
argued to likely have a shared underlying structural representation in
processing.
Even though structural priming has been found with various lin­
guistic structures, some argue that priming effects on active/passive
voice and dative constructions may not be purely structural because the
lexical entries of verbs include information about argument structure of
the sentence (e.g., Ziegler et al., 2019). On the contrary, because relative
clauses are modifiers that are not commonly viewed as part of the core
argument structure of a lexical item, they are likely not encoded in the
lexical entries of the nouns that they modify and thus in some ways
provide a more purely structural test case for priming (e.g., Desmet &
Declercq, 2006, Scheepers, 2003). However, it is important to note that
relative clause attachment priming is qualitatively different from other

forms of structural priming. In particular, the two attachment alterna­
tives convey different propositional meanings of “who did what to
whom” (compared to standard alternations such as transitives and da­
tives, where the message is comparable between the two alternative
structures). Because the choice of attachment structure is conflated with
the choice of propositional meaning, Pickering and Ferreira (2008)
suggested that relative clause attachment priming is at least in part
message level or comprehension priming. From a production perspec­
tive, attachment manipulations may affect speakers’ subsequent choice
of meaning because the typical sentence continuation (target produc­
tion) task does not require speakers to commit to expressing one
meaning versus the other, making message priming possible. From a
comprehension perspective, attachment manipulations may prime the
speakers to comprehend the target fragment as HA or LA before
continuing with their production, suggesting that the source of any
priming effect is a comprehension process. Nevertheless, relative clause
attachment priming has been widely used as a test for shared structuring
mechanisms in linguistic and non-linguistic domains alike.
Within the language domain, relative clause attachment priming has
been used to study whether bilinguals have shared structural represen­
tations for the two languages that they speak. For example, Desmet and
Declercq (2006) demonstrated cross-linguistic relative clause attach­
ment priming from Dutch to English in Dutch-English bilinguals. Par­
ticipants first completed a sentence fragment such as “Gabriel scratched
on the cover of the magazine that…” in Dutch, where “that” was
manipulated to induce an HA or LA attachment with grammatical
gender features agreeing with either “the cover” or “the magazine,”
respectively. Then, participants completed another fragment in English
that did not contain attachment-biasing grammatical features (e.g., “The
farmer fed the calves of the cow that…”). The results replicated the
structural priming effect: Participants were more likely to produce HA
continuations in English following HA Dutch primes, compared to
following LA Dutch primes. Similarly, Hartsuiker et al. (2016) reported
cross-linguistic priming in Dutch-French-English trilinguals, regardless
of whether priming was between the first and second language or two
different second languages. The authors took cross-linguistic relative
clause attachment priming as evidence that bilinguals may have a single
abstract representation for each of the relative clause attachment
structures that is shared between the languages they speak (see Van
Gompel & Arai, 2018 for a review on structural priming in bilinguals).
Priming effects of attachment height in relative clauses can be
explained by two different accounts of what information is mentally
represented. Scheepers (2003) suggested that priming results from the
specific order of applying the same set of phrase-structure rules. This
account is supported by the basic attachment priming effects that were
described above. Alternatively, Desmet and Declercq (2006) proposed a
much more general account that it is the abstract attachment height and
location that is being represented independently of phrase-structure
rules. In a sentence completion task, Loncke et al. (2011) found that
relative clause attachment (identical structure with the target, e.g., “The
tables of the restaurant that…”, with “that” grammatically agreeing with
“the tables” or “the restaurant”) and prepositional phrase attachment
(dissimilar structure with the target, e.g., “The tables of the restaurant
with their/with its…”) both primed subsequent relative clause attach­
ment. That is, priming can occur both within the same structure and
between two different structures, which supports the more general ac­
count that structural priming of attachment occurs due to the activation
of a representation of the abstract hierarchical configuration (instead of
the activation of sequences of phrase-structure rules).
Outside of language, humans frequently interact with hierarchical
structures in other domains of cognition, which raises the question of
whether structuring mechanisms of abstract structures are domaingeneral – that is, extend to representational domains beyond language.
For example, parentheses are used in arithmetic to denote the order and
scope of operations, and the resulting configurations of equations
sometimes resemble the structure of relative clause sentences. Scheepers

et al. (2011) noted these structural similarities and tested whether
priming occurs across arithmetic and language. They found that par­
ticipants were more likely to produce an HA sentence continuation after
successfully solving an equation with a structure analogous to an HA
relative clause (e.g., 80 − (9 + 1) × 5) than after solving a baseline
equation without hierarchical structure (e.g., 5 + 15). Similarly, par­
ticipants were more likely to produce a LA sentence continuation after
solving an equation analogous to a LA relative clause (e.g., 80–9 + 1 ×
5) than after the baseline condition. The observation of cross-domain
structural priming suggests that hierarchical structural information
(such as the global configuration or the shape of the structure) may be
represented at a very high level of abstraction such that it may be shared
across domains.
In a later conceptual replication of the math-to-language priming
effect (Scheepers & Sturt, 2014), it was shown that the effect is bidi­
rectional (i.e., language-to-math priming also occurs) and extends
beyond the sentence level to adjective-noun-noun compounds. Arith­
metic equations and adjective-noun-noun compounds are similar in that
they can both be organized as left- (i.e., (A B) C structure) or rightbranching (i.e., A (B C) structure), such as “5 × 2 + 7” versus “5 + 2
× 7” in math, and “organic coffee dealer” (meaning “a dealer of organic
coffee” rather than “a coffee dealer who is organic”) versus “bankrupt
coffee dealer” (meaning “a coffee dealer who is bankrupt” rather than “a
dealer of bankrupt coffee”) in adjective-noun-noun compounds. In a
series of experiments where participants solved math equations and
gave sensibility ratings (on a scale of 1 “makes no sense” to 5 “makes
perfect sense”) for the linguistic compounds, it was found that sensibility
ratings for linguistic items were higher after successfully solving an
equation of a congruent branching structure, compared to an incon­
gruent one, replicating the math-to-language priming effect. Moreover,
in a sample of participants who were predetermined to be relatively less
adept in math, arithmetic equations were more likely to be successfully
solved after giving sensibility ratings for linguistic components of a
congruent branching structure, compared to an incongruent one,
demonstrating a language-to-math priming effect. Once again, these
results corroborate the claim that structural representation may be
domain-general.
Note, however, that both Scheepers et al. (2011) and Scheepers and
Sturt (2014) pointed out that math priming effects are sensitive to many
extraneous factors, such as whether the instructions of the task explicitly
remind participants of the rules of arithmetic order of operations,
whether there are redundant parentheses in the math equations, and the
participants’ baseline math abilities. Nevertheless, Van de Cavey and
Hartsuiker (2016) further supported the cross-domain shared structural
representation account by providing evidence for both within- and
cross-domain priming. Specifically, attachment configurations in prime
items constructed with musical sequences, math, structured descriptions
of events, and relative clause sentences affected subsequent attachment
preferences in relative clause production. Additionally, the magnitude of
priming effects did not differ by whether the prime was cross-domain or
within-domain. Note, however, that when the targets were structured
descriptions of events, there was a slight advantage of within-domain
priming: attachment preferences in subsequent event descriptions
were influenced most strongly by attachment configurations in event
description primes, marginally less by relative clause primes, and
significantly less by music and math primes.
If structuring mechanisms are shared across cognitive domains, as
suggested by the ubiquitous cross-domain priming effects found across
different tasks and linguistic structures, it seems reasonable to assume
that the mechanisms may also be shared within the language domain
across units of different grain sizes (i.e., across words and sentences).
There is suggestive evidence from priming between math and language
that this assumption may be true. Recall that Scheepers et al. (2011)
found that math primed relative clause sentences, whereas Scheepers
and Sturt (2014) found bidirectional priming between math and com­
pounds of words. When combined together, these two studies suggest

that relative clause sentences and compounds of words may prime each
other, despite the difference in grain size. The current work aims to test
that exact prediction and confirm whether words and sentences indeed
have shared structuring mechanisms.
Experiment 1 tested whether attachment in relative clause sentence
production and free recall of noun phrases affected subsequent relative
clause sentence production; Experiment 2 tested whether attachment in
sentence production and noun phrase interpretation affected subsequent
noun phrase interpretation; and lastly, Experiment 3 simultaneously
tested whether attachment in sentence and noun phrase interpretation
affected subsequent sentence and noun phrase interpretation. If struc­
turing mechanisms across different linguistic levels are shared, we
should expect preferences in relative clause attachment in sentences and
morphological attachment in words to affect subsequent attachment
preferences both within- and across-grain size. Conversely, if structuring
mechanisms are not shared, we should expect sentence attachment to
only affect subsequent sentence attachment but not morphological
attachment, and vice versa.
Experiment 1

Method
Participants
Sixty undergraduates from the University of California San Diego
participated in the experiment in exchange for course credit. Twelve
participants were excluded from our analyses because they either did
not produce more than 50 % usable data (exclusion criteria explained
below in Coding and Data Analysis) or did not complete the experiment
due to technical issues. All 48 remaining participants indicated that they
were native English speakers.
Materials
The experiment was hosted on Qualtrics. We used a within-subjects 2
(Prime Attachment: High or Low) × 2 (Prime Type: Sentence or
Morphological) design. Each trial contained one prime and one target.
That is, for each trial, participants either completed a sentence fragment
prime (Sentence condition) or memorized a morphological prime
(Morphological condition), which either has a predominantly high (HA)
or low attachment (LA) meaning, before completing the target sentence
continuation task (see Procedure section below). Both the prime and
target sentence fragments were adopted from Desmet and Declercq
(2006) and Scheepers et al. (2011), whereas the morphological primes
were designed for the current work. There were 24 sentence primes and
24 morphological primes, with an equal split of HA and LA for each
prime type. There were 48 target items in total (i.e., each participant
completed 48 critical trials in this experiment). Participants were
randomly assigned to one of two experimental lists, which counter­
balanced whether a given target item was preceded by an HA or LA
prime.
The sentence primes were sentence fragments with agreement fea­
tures that coerced the production of a high or low attachment continu­
ation, such as “The firemen saved the residents of the penthouse who
were… (HA; coercing a continuation about the residents)/that was…
(LA; coercing a continuation about the penthouse)”. For morphological
primes, we constructed noun phrases of professions that either had
predominantly high or low attachment meanings. For example, “primate
researcher” was considered an HA item, with the morpheme “-er”
attaching to a higher and larger unit of “primate research” to mean
someone who studies primates (i.e., [[primate research][er]]) rather
than a primate that conducts academic studies (i.e., [[primate]
3

S.H. Lau et al.

[[research][er]]]); whereas “diligent researcher” was considered an LA
item, with “-er” attaching low to “research” to mean a hardworking
person who conducts academic studies (i.e., [[diligent][[research]
[er]]]) rather than someone who studies a discipline called “diligent
research” (i.e., [[diligent research][er]]).
Similar to the sentence primes, the target items were also sentence
fragments, except that they did not contain agreement features that
biased attachment preferences. For example, in the fragment “the florist
befriended the servant of the princesses who…”, participants could
freely choose to describe the servant (HA) or the princesses (LA).
In addition to the critical trials, participants also completed 24 filler
trials, which were interleaved with the target trials in a pseudor­
andomized order such that participants did not complete more than two
trials of the same type in a row. The filler primes were mathematical
primes adapted from the original study that reported the math priming
effect (Scheepers et al., 2011), with half of them being arithmetic
equations with HA structures (e.g., “31 + (8 – 5) × 2”) and the other half
with LA structures (e.g., “31 + 8 – 5 × 2”). Similar to critical trials, the
target items were sentence fragments that allowed participants to freely
produce a high or low attachment continuation. An analysis of the filler
items revealed that we failed to replicate the math priming effect. That
is, participants were about equally likely to produce a HA continuation
regardless of whether they successfully solved an HA or LA arithmetic
problem beforehand (44.1 % vs. 43.3 %; β = 0.002, SE = 0.16, z = 0.01,
p = .99). We performed a follow-up, Bayesian analysis to distinguish a
true null effect and inconclusive evidence, and Bayes Factor compari­
sons provide strong evidence for a null model with no effect of priming
(β = − 0.03, 95 % CI = [-0.33, 0.27], BF10 = 0.079). Given the main goal
of the current work to establish whether there are shared cognitive
mechanisms between linguistic units of different grain size rather than
across domains, we did not continue to include the mathematical fillers
in later experiments and focus our discussion below on any potential
linguistic priming effects.
The full list of prime and target materials for Experiment 1 can be
found in Appendix A.

high or low attachment noun phrase were also excluded. There were
1,782 (out of 2,304; 77 %) analyzable trials in total. Of the excluded
trials, 262 were sentence prime items that did not elicit the intended
attachment (i.e., participants creating sentences that violated agreement
features) and 260 were morphological prime items that were mis­
remembered. Valid target responses were coded in terms of whether the
freely produced relative clause attached high (HA) or low (LA).
We built a generalized linear mixed effects model with the dependent
variable of whether the target response was HA (1) or LA (0), in order to
analyze the likelihood of HA sentence continuation as a function of
Prime Type (sentence or morphological), Prime Attachment (HA or LA),
and their interaction. Fixed effects were sum-coded. Although we
attempted to use the maximal random effects structure for both models,
we removed all random slopes due to convergence issues. The model
included random intercepts for participants and items.

Procedure
Participants completed the experiment hosted on Qualtrics in the
laboratory under the supervision of an experimenter. All responses were
produced by typing.
Each trial consisted of a prime and a target task. The prime was either
a sentence or a morphological prime, which was manipulated to have
either a high (HA) or low (LA) attachment structural organization.
Participants were given instructions to perform a sentence continuation
task and a noun phrase free recall task, but they were not informed of the
prime-target manipulation. For sentence continuation, participants were
instructed to type a response that formed a complete sentence whenever
they were presented with a sentence fragment. For free recall, partici­
pants were told to expect to see a noun phrase displayed on the screen
for three seconds and to memorize the given noun phrase in preparation
for free recall at a later time. Free recall for each morphological prime
was always prompted immediately after the associated target item. In
other words, when the participant completed a trial with a sentence
prime, they first completed a sentence with attachment-biasing agree­
ment features, then another sentence without such features. If the
participant completed a trial with a morphological prime, they first saw
a noun phrase and attempted to keep it in their working memory while
completing a sentence without attachment-biasing agreement features,
then recalled the noun phrase afterwards.

Post-hoc Bayesian analyses
Frequentist analyses can only reject a null hypothesis, so we per­
formed post-hoc Bayesian analyses to adjudicate whether observed null
results from frequentist analyses reflect support for the null hypothesis
or whether the results are simply inconclusive. These analyses were not
pre-registered. Using the brms package in R (Bürkner, 2019), we fit
generalized linear mixed effects models with the same specifications as
the frequentist models. We assumed a Bernoulli distribution with a logit
link function due to the binary nature of the data. We used default priors
for all random effects and variance estimates (half-student t-distribu­
tions with 3 degrees of freedom). All priors are in log-odds terms. We did
not use default priors for coefficients of fixed effects, as these default
priors are uniform (and, therefore, improper), and using them can lead
to inconsistent calculations. Coefficient estimates for fixed effects were
given a normal prior with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 2. This
prior choice avoids flat, improper priors but is wide enough to avoid
making stringent assumptions. Each Bayesian model had four Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains of 10,000 iterations total, 2,000 of
which were for warm-up. This resulted in 32,000 post-warm up samples
per model. Divergent transitions during sampling can lead to inaccurate
posterior estimates, so when we encountered divergent transitions, we
increased “adapt delta” from the default value of 0.85. Higher values of
this parameter slow down the sampler but ensure more accurate tran­
sitions. All R-hat values were equal to 1.00 after sampling, indicating no
convergence issues.
For critical (sentence and morphological priming) trials, we fit five
nested models for our main analysis: a full model with Prime Type,
Prime Attachment, and a Prime Type × Prime Attachment interaction; a
model with both main effects but no interaction term; a model with only
Prime Type as a fixed effect; a model with only Prime Attachment as a
fixed effect; and an intercept-only model (i.e., a model without fixed
effects). We fit four models for the follow-up planned comparisons.
Within each prime type, we fit models with and without prime attach­
ment as a fixed effect. We compared nested models using brms functions
to produce Bayes Factors indicating relative support for one model over
the other. We generally used guidelines from Kass and Raftery (1995)
when interpreting strength of evidence given by Bayes Factors but these
analyses (and, therefore, these inference criteria) were not preregistered. Generally, Bayes Factors less than 1 indicate relative sup­
port for the model with fewer terms, and Bayes Factors greater than 1
indicate relative support for the model with more terms. We reported the
coefficient estimate of the term, the 95 % credible interval of the coef­
ficient estimate, and the Bayes Factor.

Coding and analyses
Every prime response that was incompatible with our intended prime
attachment manipulation (i.e., when participants ignored the sentence
agreement features or inaccurately recalled the memory items) was
deemed invalid and left out of our analyses. Additionally, target re­
sponses in which it was unclear whether the relative clause modified the

Results and discussion
Fig. 1 shows the average proportion of HA responses following HA or
LA sentence or morphological primes. On average, participants were
numerically more likely to produce a HA sentence following a HA prime,
compared to a LA prime (the main effect of Prime Attachment was
marginally significant; β = − 0.20, SE = 0.11, z = − 1.86, p = .06). We

limitation, rather than a distinct structuring mechanism for words. To
further test the robustness and directionality of the priming effects (or
the lack thereof), we changed how the morphological primes were
presented and switched the target task to a morphological task in
Experiment 2.
Experiment 2
Method
Participants
Two hundred and fifty-two undergraduates from the University of
California San Diego participated in exchange for course credit. All
participants indicated that they were native English speakers. Experi­
ment 2 contained many fewer trials than did Experiment 1 (only eight
items), so a power analysis was conducted using data from a pilot
experiment to determine the target sample size. The analysis estimated
that 250 participants would be sufficient to achieve 80 % power in this
experiment. All participants produced more than 50 % valid data for
analysis (see Coding and Analyses for criteria) and thus no one was
excluded.
Materials
Similar to Experiment 1, we used a within-subjects 2 (Prime
Attachment: High or Low) × 2 (Prime Type: Sentence or Morphological)
design, with each trial containing a prime and target pair. The sentence
primes were sentence fragments with agreement features that coerced
either a high (HA) or low attachment (LA) continuation, whereas the
morphological primes were noun phrases of professions that had pre­
dominantly HA or LA interpretations. The prime materials in Experi­
ment 2 were a subset of the ones used in Experiment 1.
The target items were noun phrases that were judged to be relatively
ambiguous in a pilot experiment (e.g., “Russian teacher”). On a 1–7
Likert scale (with 1 meaning the given noun phrase can only have the LA
interpretation, e.g., “someone who teaches and is of Russian descent”;
and 7 only the HA interpretation, e.g., “someone who teaches the
Russian language”), we selected eight noun phrases (out of 48 in the
pilot) with mean ratings closest to the midpoint of the scale (mean
ratings ranged from 3.19 to 4.65) and relatively high variance in ratings
(standard deviations ranged from 1.97 to 2.52). These two features of
the selected items maximized the chance of the interpretations of these
noun phrases being influenced depending on the preceding prime, if
there was indeed any priming effect.
The pilot experiment had the same design as Experiment 2 (described
below). The main difference was that the pilot included 48 target items,
many of which we eliminated due to participants having an extremely
strong preference for one interpretation. For example, we eliminated
“animal activist” due to a strong preference for the HA interpretation (a
mean rating of 6.82, SD = 0.44, in favor of the interpretation “someone
who advocates for animal rights”), as opposed to the LA interpretation
(“an animal who advocates for a cause”). After narrowing down to eight
items by considering the mean and variability in ratings, we simulated
new data using pilot data for those specific items to estimate the new
sample size required by using the “simr” package.
Due to the difficulty in finding relatively ambiguous noun phrases,
there were only eight target trials in Experiment 2. That is, there were
four sentence and four morphological primes (equal split of HA and LA),
paired with eight morphological target items. Participants were
randomly assigned to one of four counterbalancing lists, in which the
Prime Type and Prime Attachment for each target item were counter­
balanced across lists. The full list of prime and target materials for
Experiment 2 can be found in Appendix B.

also observed a marginal Prime Type × Prime Attachment interaction (β
= − 0.38, SE = 0.21, z = − 1.76, p = .08). Participants were no more
likely to produce HA sentences following HA morphological primes (M
= 49.2 %, SE = 2.47 %), compared to following LA morphological
primes (M = 49 %, SE = 2.94 %); the pairwise comparison was not
significant (z = 0.07, p = .94). However, participants were 9.3 % more
likely to produce HA sentences following HA sentence primes (M = 46.2
%, SE = 3.38 %), compared to following LA sentence primes (M = 36.9
%, SE = 3.27 %), and this pairwise comparison was significant (z = 2.56,
p = .01).
We performed three Bayes Factor comparisons between nested
models. First, to evaluate the Prime Type × Prime Attachment interac­
tion, we compared the full model to a reduced model with Prime Type
and Prime Attachment as fixed effects but no interaction. The Bayes
Factor obtained is generally considered to indicate inconclusive evi­
dence (β = − 0.37, 95 % CI = [-0.80, 0.05], BF10 = 0.489). Follow-up
planned comparisons show evidence against an effect of Prime Attach­
ment with morphological primes (β = 0.02, CI = [-0.49, 0.50], BF10 =
0.074). There was equivocal evidence for a main effect of Prime
Attachment with sentence primes (β = − 0.42, CI = [-0.72, − 0.12], BF10
= 2.96), but the model estimates are numerically consistent with the
frequentist statistics. To test for main effects, we compared a model with
the term of interest to the intercept-only model. We found evidence
against main effects of Prime Type (β = − 0.34, CI = [-0.89, 0.20], BF10
= 0.300) and Prime Attachment (β = − 0.20, CI = [-0.41, 0.01], BF10 =
0.310).
In sum, our results from Experiment 1 provide suggestive evidence
that only sentence (but not morphological) attachment preference
affected later sentence production. The marginal interaction is consis­
tent with the possibility that the structuring mechanisms between the
two levels may not be shared. However, the lack of morphological effect
on later sentence production may be attributed to one limitation of the
design: The free recall task did not require the participants to think
about the possible meanings of the morphological primes. If the hier­
archical structures of morphemes that give rise to different meanings of
noun phrases were not activated by the free recall task, the absence of
priming effects in the morphological conditions may reflect this

Each trial consisted of a prime and a target task. The prime was either
a sentence or a morphological prime, which was manipulated to have
either a high (HA) or low (LA) attachment structural organization.
Participants were given instructions to perform a sentence continuation
task and a semantic judgment task, but they were not informed of the
prime-target manipulation. For sentence continuation, participants were
instructed to type a response that formed a complete sentence whenever
they were presented with a sentence fragment. This task served as the
sentence prime. For semantic judgment, participants were instructed to
rate the likelihood of the possible meanings of noun phrases on a 1–7
Likert scale (with 1 meaning the given noun phrase can only have the LA
interpretation, and 7 only the HA interpretation). When participants
were asked to rate noun phrases with predominant meanings, this task
served as the morphological prime (and to validate the manipulation;
see below); when participants were asked to rate relatively ambiguous
noun phrases, this task served as the target task.
To summarize, when the participant completed a trial with a sen­
tence prime, they first completed a sentence with attachment-biasing
agreement features, then gave a semantic judgment for an ambiguous
noun phrase. If the participant completed a trial with a morphological
prime, they first rated a noun phrase with a predominant meaning, then
rated an ambiguous noun phrase. Because the semantic judgment task
specifically required participants to think about the possible meanings of
the morphological primes and targets, it resolved the limitation pre­
sented by Experiment 1.

− 2.61, p = .009). However, this was likely driven by the morphological
primes; there was a significant Prime Type × Prime Attachment inter­
action (β ¼ 0.18, SE = 0.18, z = 2.10, p = .036). Participants rated
ambiguous noun phrases similarly following HA sentence primes (M =
− 0.02, SE = 0.19), compared to following LA sentence primes (M =
0.01, SE = 0.19); the pairwise comparison was not significant (t = 0.34,
p = .73). In contrast, participants rated ambiguous noun phrases 0.21 zscore units higher following HA morphological primes (M = 0.16, SE =
0.19), compared to LA sentence primes (M = − 0.05, SE = 0.19), and this
pairwise comparison was significant (t = 3.50, p = .0005).
Parallel Bayesian analyses were consistent with our frequentist re­
sults. The computed Bayes Factor was inconclusive regarding the Prime
Type × Prime Attachment interaction (β = 0.18, 95 % CI = [0.01, 0.34],
BF10 = 0.386). Taken together with the significant effect in our fre­
quentist analysis, we interpret the interaction as marginally significant.
Follow-up planned comparisons revealed strong evidence for an effect of
Prime Attachment for morphological primes (β = − 0.20, CI = [-0.31,
− 0.09], BF10 = 15.70) and strong evidence against an effect of Prime
Attachment for sentence primes (β = − 0.02, CI = [-0.15, 0.10], BF10 =
0.033).
Evidence was inconclusive with regards to a main effect of Prime
Attachment (β = − 0.12, 95 % CI = [-0.20, − 0.04], BF10 = 1.04) and
strongly against a main effect of Prime Type (β = − 0.04, 95 % CI =
[-0.12, 0.05], BF10 = 0.031).
To summarize, Experiment 2 showed stronger evidence that only
morphological (but not sentence) attachment preference affected later
ambiguous noun phrase interpretation. Along with the results in
Experiment 1, our results suggest that structuring mechanisms are not
shared across grain size.
One alternative interpretation for the results of Experiment 1 and 2 is
that the patterns simply reflected task priming (i.e., sentence completion
primes sentence completion and semantic interpretation primes se­
mantic interpretation) rather than priming within linguistic units of the
same grain size. Specifically, Experiment 1 showed that sentence
completion (but not morphological recall) primed sentence completion,
and Experiment 2 showed that semantic interpretation (but not sentence
completion) primed semantic interpretation. In other words, the target
task and grain size were confounded. To control for the possibility of
task priming, we ensured that all tasks were semantic interpretation
tasks in Experiment 3. Additionally, the target task was always sentence
production in Experiment 1 and noun phrase semantic interpretation in

Coding and analyses
Prime responses that were incompatible with our intended prime
attachment manipulation (i.e., when participants ignored the sentence
agreement features, rated LA primes as 4 or above, or HA primes as 4 or
below) were deemed invalid and left out of our analyses, leaving 1,661
(out of 2016; 82 %) analyzable trials in total. The ratings for valid target
responses (1–7) were then transformed into z-score units using bysubject means and standard deviations to account for individual differ­
ences in how participants use scales and susceptibility to priming.
We built a linear mixed effects model with the dependent variable
being the rating for each trial in z-score units, in order to analyze the
attachment preference for ambiguous noun phrases as a function of
Prime Type (sentence or morphological), Prime Attachment (HA or LA),
and their interaction. Fixed effects were sum-coded. Although we
attempted to use the maximal random effects structures, we removed all
random slopes due to convergence issues. We also removed the partic­
ipant random intercept due to convergence issues and by-participant
variance estimates of 0. Because the response variable was z-scored
within a participant, it was not surprising that there was very little
variation between participants.
Post-hoc Bayesian analyses
We fit Bayesian mixed effects models using the same specifications
and approach as Experiment 1, except where noted below. The depen­
dent variable in Experiment 2 was the z-scored rating for ambiguous
noun phrases, so we used linear mixed effects models with a Gaussian
distribution and an identity link function. We fit five models for our
main analysis: a full model with Prime Type and Prime Attachment as
fixed effects and their interaction, a model without the interaction term,
a model with only Prime Type, a model with only Prime Attachment,
and an intercept-only model. We fit four models for the follow-up
planned comparisons. Within each prime type, we fit models with and
without prime attachment as a fixed effect.
Results and discussion
Fig. 2 shows the mean rating for ambiguous noun phrases (in z-score
units) following HA or LA sentence or morphological primes. On
average, participants rated ambiguous noun phrases following HA
primes 0.09 z-score units higher than following LA primes (the main
effect of Prime Attachment was significant; β = − 0.11, SE = 0.04, z =

Experiment 2 regardless of the prime type, which led to participants
experiencing more trials of a particular grain size in each experiment. In
Experiment 3, we assessed semantic interpretation of both sentences and
noun phrases in the target task.

HA sentence prime “the boy teased the hamsters of the girl that were
running around”, participants first attempted to memorize the sentence
and advanced to the next page when ready. Then, when prompted with
the question “Who was/were running around?”, participants rated on a
scale of 1–7 the likelihood of the interpretation being “the girl” (LA; 1 on
the scale) or “the hamsters” (HA; 7 on the scale).
In the Same Prime-Target Pairing condition, participants rated an
unambiguous sentence prime (HA or LA meaning) followed by an
ambiguous sentence target, or rated an unambiguous noun phrase prime
(HA or LA) followed by an ambiguous noun phrase target. In the
Different Prime-Target Pairing condition, participants rated an unam­
biguous sentence prime followed by an ambiguous noun phrase target,
or rated an unambiguous noun phrase prime followed by an ambiguous
sentence target. Because both prime types operated under a semantic
interpretation task, this design helped us rule out the possibility that the
pattern priming effects revealed in Experiments 1 and 2 were due to
task-specific priming. That is, given that all primes are now in the same
task, if the structuring mechanisms are indeed not shared across grain
sizes, we should only observe priming effects in the Same but not
Different Prime-Target Pairing conditions.

Experiment 3
Method
Participants
Two hundred and sixty-two undergraduates from the University of
California San Diego participated in exchange for course credit. Ten
participants were excluded who either did not produce more than 50 %
valid data (see Coding and Analyses for criteria) or otherwise did not
complete the experiment due to technical issues. The remaining two
hundred and fifty-two participants indicated that they were native En­
glish speakers.
Materials
To address concerns of task priming and imbalanced numbers of
trials for different grain sizes in previous experiments, we used a withinsubjects 2 (Prime Attachment: High or Low) × 2 (Prime Type: Sentence
or Morphological) × 2 (Prime-Target Pairing: Same or Different grain
size) design. Consistent with previous experiments, each trial contained
a prime and target pair, and the prime was either a sentence or a noun
phrase of an HA or LA organization. Unlike previous experiments, the
grain size of the linguistic unit in the target was not held constant.
Instead, it was an equal split between sentence and noun phrase targets.
That is, the Same Prime-Target Pairing condition included trials in
which the prime and target were both sentences, or both noun phrases;
the Different Prime-Target Pairing condition included trials where a
noun phrase target was primed by a sentence, or where a sentence target
was primed by a noun phrase.
The sentence primes were similar to the materials in Experiments 1
and 2. Instead of sentence fragments, we presented participants with
complete sentences that utilized agreement features to coerce HA or LA
meanings in Experiment 3, such as “The boy teased the hamsters of the
girl that were running around (HA)/who was an animal advocate (LA)”.
The morphological primes were identical to the materials of Experiment
2 (i.e., noun phrases with predominantly HA or LA meanings).
The sentence targets were complete sentences with ambiguous
agreement features, such that both HA and LA meanings were plausible.
For instance, in “someone shot the servant of the actress who was on the
balcony”, it is unclear who was on the balcony (i.e., both “the servant”
and “the actress” are plausible). The morphological targets were rela­
tively ambiguous noun phrases identical to the materials in Experiment
2.
There were eight sentence primes and eight morphological primes,
with an equal split between HA and LA structures. They were paired
with eight sentence and eight morphological targets. That is, each
participant completed 16 trials in total. Participants were randomly
assigned to one of four counterbalancing lists, in which the prime type
and attachment that preceded each target were counterbalanced. The
full list of prime and target materials for Experiment 3 can be found in
Appendix C.

Coding and analyses
Prime responses that were incompatible with our intended prime
attachment manipulation (i.e., when participants rated LA primes as 4 or
above, or HA primes as 4 or below) were deemed invalid and left out of
our analyses, leaving 3653 (out of 4032 trials; 90 %) analyzable trials in
total. The ratings for valid target responses (1–7) were then transformed
into z-score units using by-subject means and standard deviations to
account for individual differences in how participants used scales and
susceptibility to priming.
In the main analysis, we built a linear mixed effects model with the
dependent variable being the rating for each trial in z-score units, in
order to analyze the attachment preference of ambiguous target items as
a function of Prime Attachment (HA or LA), Prime-Target Pairing (Same
or Different), and their interaction. The random effects structure
included a by-item intercept. Consistent with Experiment 2, we removed
random slopes and the intercept for participants due to convergence
issues and small participants variability after z-scoring. This analysis
allowed us to confirm whether there was a baseline attachment priming
effect, and whether such an effect was unique to linguistic units of the
same grain size.
In a secondary analysis, we added to the original linear mixed effects
model. The dependent variable was still the rating for each trial in zscore units, whereas the independent variables were Prime Type (Sen­
tence or Morphological), Prime Attachment (HA or LA), Prime-Target
Pairing (Same or Different), as well as all two-way and three-way in­
teractions. Fixed effects were sum-coded. The random effects structure
was the same as above. This analysis lent insights into whether the
priming effects (if any) differed for sentence versus morphological items.
Post-hoc Bayesian analyses
Our model fitting procedures were nearly identical to Experiment 2,
except where noted below. Our first analysis involved a model with
Prime-Target Pairing, Prime Attachment, and their interaction with a
by-item random intercept. We then built four additional nested models:
a model with Prime-Target Pairing and Prime Attachment but no
interaction, a model with only Prime-Target Pairing, a model with only
Prime Attachment, and an intercept-only model. For the second analysis,
we fit a model with Prime-Target Pairing, Prime Attachment, and Prime
Type as well as all two-way interactions and a three-way interaction
between Prime-Target Pairing, Prime Attachment, and Prime Type. Our
goal with this model was to assess whether the interaction between
Prime-Target Pairing and Prime Attachment further differs across
morphological and sentential prime types, so we only tested for the
three-way interaction with Bayesian analyses.

Procedure
The experiment was a typed experiment hosted on Qualtrics. Par­
ticipants completed the experiment online without supervision.
The task in Experiment 3 was a semantic judgment task, regardless of
whether participants were responding to a sentence or a noun phrase,
and whether the item served as a prime or a target. Participants were
instructed to first memorize the item on the screen, then to perform a
semantic judgment task with a 1–7 Likert scale (with 1 meaning the LA
interpretation was possible and 7 meaning only the HA interpretation
was possible) on the next page. For example, when presented with the

Results and discussion
Fig. 3 shows the mean ratings for ambiguous target items (in z-score
units) following HA or LA primes of same or different prime-target
pairing. On average, when the prime and target were of the same
grain size, the ratings were 0.17 z-score units higher than when the
prime and target were of different grain sizes (the main effect of PrimeTarget Pairing was significant; β = 0.18, SE = 0.03, t = 5.16, p < .001).
To address whether attachment priming was specific to linguistic
units of the same grain size only, we turned to the main effect of Prime
Attachment and the Prime Attachment × Prime-Target Pairing interac­
tion. The average ratings for target items following HA and LA primes
were comparable (i.e., no main effect of Prime Attachment; β = − 0.03,
SE = 0.03, t = − 1.30, p = .19). However, when grain size was taken into
account, we found that priming effect was present among linguistic units
of the same grain size but not among units of different grain sizes (i.e., a
significant Prime Attachment × Prime Target Pairing interaction; β =
− 0.20, SE = 0.06, t = − 3.43, p < .001). Specifically, when the prime and
the target were of the same grain size, there was a 0.12 z-score units
difference in ratings for target items following HA primes (M = 0.14, SE
= 0.09) versus LA primes (M = 0.02, SE = 0.09); the pairwise compar­
ison was significant (z = 3.39, p < .001). However, when the prime and
the target were of different grain sizes, the ratings following HA (M =
− 0.12, SE = 0.09) and LA primes (M = − 0.05, SE = 0.09) were com­
parable; the pairwise comparison was not significant (z = − 1.49, p =
.14).
Post-hoc Bayesian analyses replicated and extended our frequentist
results. We observed a main effect of Prime-Target pairing (β = 0.18, 95
% CI = [0.12, 0.24], BF10 = 1.91 × 106) and an interaction between
Prime-Target pairing and Prime Attachment (β = − 0.20, 95 % CI = [
− 0.32, − 0.09], BF10 = 10.46). There was evidence against a main effect
of Prime Attachment (β = − 0.05, 95 % CI = [-0.10, 0.01], BF10 = 0.049).
Follow-up comparisons show evidence for a main effect of Prime
Attachment when grain size is the same (β = − 0.14, CI = [-0.22, − 0.06],
BF10 = 5.56) and evidence against a main effect of Prime Attachment
when grain size is different (β = 0.06, CI = [-0.02, 0.14], BF10 = 0.062).
In our secondary analysis, we added the variable of Prime Type into
the model to examine whether the priming effect was modulated by
whether the prime was a sentence or a noun phrase. Fig. 4 further breaks
down Fig. 3 into the two prime types. In regards to results involving the
new addition of Prime Type, we only found a marginal Prime Type ×
Prime-Target Pairing interaction (β = − 0.71, SE = 0.36, t = − 1.94, p =
.07), such that the average ratings for morphological targets were 0.54 z-

score units higher when the primes were also morphological, compared
to when the primes were sentences (z = − 2.91, p = .003). The ratings for
sentence targets were comparable when primes were of the same or
different grain size (− 1.70 z-score units difference; z = 0.92, p = .36).
Critically, there was no main effect of Prime Type, Prime Attach­
ment × Prime Type interaction, nor Prime Attachment × Prime-Target
Pairing × Prime Type interaction. The main effect of Prime-Target
Pairing reported in the main analysis remained significant after add­
ing Prime Type to the model (β = − 0.18, SE = 0.03, t = 6.27, p < .001),
as did the interaction between Prime-Target Pairing and Prime Attach­
ment (β = − 0.20, SE = 0.06, t = − 3.48, p < .001). In other words, there
was no evidence to suggest that the priming effects we reported were
dependent on whether the prime was a sentence or a noun phrase.
Our second set of Bayesian analyses involved testing whether there
was a three-way interaction between Prime Type, Prime Attachment,
and Prime-Target Pairing. Bayes Factor comparisons produced evidence
against such an interaction (β = − 0.07, 95 % CI = [-0.31, 0.16], BF10 =
0.073). We also obtained Bayes Factor evidence in favor of a Prime
Attachment × Prime-Target Pairing interaction, consistent with our
main analysis (β = − 0.20, CI = [-0.32, − 0.09], BF10 = 11.34).
Taken together, we found evidence suggesting that attachment
priming most likely only occurs when the prime and target were lin­
guistic units of the same grain size. That is, structuring mechanisms are
likely not shared between the sentence and the morphological level.
General discussion
In three experiments, the current work investigated whether the
structuring mechanisms for linguistic units of different grain sizes are
shared. Specifically, we tested whether relative clause attachment in
sentences and morphological attachment in noun phrases shared struc­
turing mechanisms and thus showed bidirectional priming effects. We
used a variety of tasks throughout the experiments, but priming was
generally operationalized throughout as whether participants were
more likely to produce or interpret a relatively attachment-neutral
target item with high attachment (HA) bias following the production

or comprehension of an HA prime, compared to following producing or
interpreting a low attachment (LA) prime. Based on previous work on
structural priming in relative clause sentences (e.g., Desmet & Declercq,
2006; Scheepers, 2003), we expected to replicate this priming effect
within the same grain size at least on the sentence level. At the time of
the completion of our work, we were not aware of any previous work
showing within-domain priming on the morphological level among
ambiguous noun phrases (only cross-domain priming from math to
adjective-noun-noun compounds in Scheepers & Sturt, 2014). However,
we expected to see the priming effect from noun phrases to other noun
phrases if such an effect extends beyond the sentence level (i.e., priming
should be observed in any linguistic units that indeed have similar un­
derlying structures despite differences in surface features and mean­
ings). Critically, if the structuring mechanisms were shared across grain
sizes, we should see attachment priming from sentences to noun phrases,
and vice versa. If the mechanisms were distinct, then we should see
within-level priming as described above only.
Experiment 1 examined whether attachment preferences in relative
clause sentence production and in free recall of noun phrases affected
subsequent relative clause sentence production. The results showed that
participants were numerically more likely to produce HA relative clause
sentences following HA primes (compared to following LA primes), but a
marginal interaction (and the accompanying pairwise comparisons)
suggested that this should only be taken as suggestive evidence that the
effect was most likely driven by the sentence primes. That is, we repli­
cated the relative clause priming effect reported in the literature but
found no strong evidence that noun phrases could prime sentence pro­
duction. However, to establish that there is no cross-grain size priming,
we needed to establish a double dissociation. Moreover, it was unclear at
that point whether noun phrases could produce priming effects at all,
even within-level. If there is no cross-grain size priming, the result
should be bi-directional.
Experiment 2 examined whether attachment preferences in relative
clause sentence production and in noun phrase comprehension affected
subsequent noun phrase comprehension. The results demonstrated that
participants rated the HA interpretation of an ambiguous noun phrase as
more probable following an HA prime (compared to following an LA
prime), but the patterns were mostly driven by the morphological
primes. These patterns are important in two different ways: First, we
presented novel evidence showing that structural priming effects within
the linguistic domain extend beyond the sentence level to ambiguous
noun phrase comprehension. Second, morphological (but not sentence)
attachment preferences affected subsequent morphological attachment
preferences. Crucial to the question of the sharedness of structuring
mechanisms across linguistic units of different grain sizes, the combi­
nation of the results in Experiment 1 and 2 resembled a double disso­
ciation, suggesting that the mechanisms are distinct.
However, the interpretation of Experiments 1 and 2 is challenged by
the fact that because the tasks for the two linguistic levels were different,
our results could have been explained by preferences in sentence
continuation priming sentence continuation but not semantic interpre­
tation, and vice versa, regardless of grain size. As such, Experiment 3
sought to confirm the double dissociation and to eliminate the possi­
bility of explaining the dissociation via task priming by holding the tasks
across grain sizes constant (i.e., all tasks were semantic interpretation
tasks).
Experiment 3 compared whether attachment preferences in sentence
and morphological comprehension affected subsequent comprehension
preferences in the same versus different linguistic level. The results
showed that attachment priming was indeed only present in linguistic
units of the same grain size. Further analysis found no evidence sug­
gesting any difference in priming magnitude for different grain sizes,
meaning that the results are unlikely to be driven by one particular grain
size. Additionally, prime and target tasks for all conditions were the
same, so the results could not be reduced to task priming. Altogether, the
results from three experiments suggested that structuring mechanisms

for linguistic units of different grain sizes are not shared.
Given the evidence for cross-domain priming in the literature (e.g.,
Scheepers et al., 2011; Scheepers & Sturt, 2014; Van de Cavey & Hart­
suiker, 2016), it is somewhat surprising that we failed to observe crossgrain size priming within the linguistic domain. Our main goal with
these experiments was to explore cross-domain priming within language
systems rather than outside of them, and so we can only speculate as to
why there is evidence in the literature that mathematics and music
prime relative clause attachment, but morphological organization does
not (and why relative clause attachment does not prime morphological
organization).
One straightforward possibility is that processes that underlie
morphological organization themselves are isolated from influences of
processes that drive structural organization outside the morphological
system. In addition to being consistent with the current results, this
possibility predicts that manipulations of morphological organization
should fail to prime or be primed by the non-linguistic systems of or­
ganization that have been shown to affect relative-clause attachment
(namely, music and math).
An observation relevant to the possible isolability of the processes
that organize morphological representations comes from Scheepers and
Sturt (2014). They showed that the structural organization of math
problems (e.g., 25–4 × 3, which is right-branching, vs. 25 × 4–3, which
is left-branching) affected how adjective-noun-noun phrases were
interpreted (bankrupt coffee dealer, which is right branching, vs. organic
coffee dealer, which is left-branching), and vice versa. Two consider­
ations potentially limit the informativeness of this result with respect to
the claim here of the potential isolation of morphological processes.
First, as with relative clauses (as noted next), it is possible that a level of
organization outside of morphology affects performance (e.g., rhythm,
prosody) in both the linguistic and nonlinguistic domains, which is less
likely to be true with respect to the level of morphology at stake here (e.
g., Russian teacher). Second, it is reasonable to posit that the structural
organization of an adjective-noun-noun sequence is at a syntactic level,
unlike the organization that distinguishes the interpretations of the
morphological structural alternatives here. In all, further research is
needed to directly address this point.
More generally, the possible isolability of the processes that deter­
mine the type of morphological organization investigated here has not
(to our knowledge) been addressed in the broader psycholinguistic
literature (indeed, filling just this gap was a main objective of this
project). Most investigations of the processes that determine morpho­
logical organization have focused on more traditional questions of, for
example, whether morphology operates in a structurally independent
manner (separately from phonology or semantics; e.g., Dohmes, Zwit­
serlood, & Bölte, 2004; Koester & Schiller, 2008; Zwitserlood, Bölte, and
Dohmes, 2000). This literature generally suggests that morphological
processing can be characterized as operating in a structurally indepen­
dent way, which is consistent with, but does not necessarily require, a
system isolated from external influences.
A different (but perhaps related) possibility about which we can only
offer vague speculations is that relative-clause attachment, mathe­
matics, and music may share some organizational component that is not
shared with morphological organization. For example, it may be that
some rhythmic, prosody-like process (e.g., Jun & Bishop, 2015) operates
in relative-clause attachment, mathematics, and music but not during
morphological organization. Or, relative-clause attachment, mathe­
matics, and music may share some less-superficial level of organization
that is more abstract and general (i.e., global configuration and shape).
Finally, it is worth noting that cross-domain structural priming may
be highly sensitive to nuances in processing. For example, Scheepers
et al. (2011) did not observe math priming in participants who were
explicitly reminded of the operator-precedence rules before the experi­
ment, which may have encouraged them to strategically direct their
attention towards searching for the multiplication and division opera­
tors. The authors speculated that explicit instruction dampened priming

the case of relative clause attachment, English speakers tend to have a
low attachment preference in production (as shown in our data and
previous work, e.g., Scheepers et al., 2011), and other semantic cues in
discourse may aid in comprehension. Additionally, our pilot data indi­
cated that comprehenders often have strong interpretation preferences
for noun phrases that could have more than one plausible meanings due
to attachment ambiguity (which led to the small number of morpho­
logical target items in our experiments). It is unclear whether there is a
clear morphological attachment preference in noun phrases and multi­
morphemic words in the English language as a whole, and whether that
preference aligns with the low attachment preference in sentences. And
if so, how do cognitive factors (such as memory and attentional con­
straints) guide those statistics? In Scheepers and Sturt (2014)’s data,
sensibility ratings tended to be higher for right-branching than for leftbranching adjective-noun-noun compounds, though it is unclear in what
the preference would be in noun phrases like our materials where both
HA and LA alternatives are right-branching. Corpus studies with
attachment statistics on the morphological level and comparisons with
statistics on the sentence level will lend important insights into the
universality of cognitive biases in language use.
To conclude, the current study used attachment ambiguity and
priming to investigate the sharedness of structuring mechanisms for
linguistic units of different grain sizes, namely relative clause sentences
and noun phrases. Based on results across three experiments showing
that priming was only observed between linguistic units of the same
grain size, we concluded that the structuring mechanisms on the sen­
tence level and the morphological level are likely not shared.

effects due to these effects being relatively dependent on implicit pro­
cessing. In terms of the online processing dynamics of words versus
sentences, it is possible that high frequency noun phrases and words
have “larger chunks” of stored meanings, whose semantics are not
computed by assembling each morpheme on-the-fly in ways comparable
to how comprehenders identifies what entity a relative clause modifies
in real-time (although such a possibility fails to explain why the current
experiments found priming from morphology to morphology). Thus, low
frequency morphological items or a task that requires participants to
create new words and phrases may offer a promising avenue into
furthering our understanding of the processing of morphological
structures.
The current work ultimately demonstrates within-level linguistic
attachment priming in comprehension, but a few modality-specific
research questions remain unanswered. On the sentence level, there is
evidence that distributional patterns in relative clause production are
linked to comprehension performance. For example, Gennari and Mac­
Donald (2009) reported compatible production preferences in both ex­
periments and corpora, showing that passive structures were more likely
to be produced with theme-experiencer verbs than with agent-theme
verbs, and when two nouns mismatched in animacy than when were
both animate. Critically, they also showed that passive production rates
predicted reading times in comprehending active object relative clauses,
with more commonly passivized verb type and animacy configurations
in production being associated with more comprehension difficulties in
an active relative clause. While sentence production distributional pat­
terns and comprehension performances are linked, due to the difficulty
in designing a production task on the morphological level, it is unclear
whether noun phrase production affects subsequent noun phrase pro­
duction or comprehension.
Aside from innovating ways to measure morphological production,
future work may also specify how the structuring mechanisms for
different linguistic units differ, and further explore how these nonshared mechanisms are integrated in online production and compre­
hension. In the interest of keeping the results and the experimental logic
comparable to previous work in the generality of structuring mecha­
nisms, the current work chose to use specific test cases of linguistic
ambiguity coupled with a structural priming paradigm, which allowed
for clear predictions of behaviors. Although ambiguity is ubiquitous in
everyday language use, speakers and comprehenders do not always
detect it because their prior knowledge and linguistic biases often help
them convey or derive the intended meaning effectively. For instance, in
