Introduction
Visual working memory (VWM) is the ability of individuals to
temporarily maintain and manipulate visual information and is the
foundation for advanced cognitive processes (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974).
Researchers have demonstrated that individuals can adjust the priority
of information processing depending on ongoing task demands (Myers
et al., 2017). However, the nature of interactions between information
of varying priorities in VWM remains debated.
Some earlier studies have suggested a resource-based model, where
more cognitive resources are devoted to prioritized memory items
(PMIs) than to unprioritized memory items (UMIs) (Bays & Husain,
2008; Ma et al., 2014). For example, the items associated with higher
reward (Hitch et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2016) or with higher probability to
recall (Hollingworth & Maxcey-Richard, 2013; W. Zhang & Luck, 2008)
could be maintained as PMIs, resulting in better recall performance. In
contrast, recent researchers have proposed a state-based model, positing
PMIs and UMIs are maintained in distinct states: PMIs are directly

related to the ongoing task and require real-time processing, and their
representations are always active, while UMIs are not necessary for the
ongoing task and are kept in a more passive storage state (Cowan, 2001;
Olivers et al., 2011). Compared with the resource-based model, the
state-based model prefers fewer interactions between items of varying
priorities and dissociated neural basis underlying them. This indepen­
dent storage view has been strengthened by an earlier behavioral study,
which required participants to remember two rows of numbers and
perform an arithmetic operation on specific numbers in one row (PMIs
in the active row) but just to store numbers in the other row (UMIs in the
passive row) during the interval, and reported all numbers at the end
(Oberauer, 2002). They found that only the recall for UMIs became
poorer with increased delay duration and interference. Additionally,
reaction times during arithmetic operations were affected only by the
load of PMIs but not UMIs. Some other studies established recall-order
prioritization, designating first-recalled items as PMIs and laterrecalled items as UMIs (Z. Li et al., 2021; Nee & Jonides, 2011). For
example, the recent study employed a double retro-cue design, requiring

participants to make change detection judgments sequentially on two
memorized items(Z. Li et al., 2021). They demonstrated that increasing
the memory load of the first-recalled PMIs did not affect the perfor­
mance of the later-recalled UMIs, and vice versa.
Moreover, this independent storage view has been supported by
neuroimaging studies, where the prioritization was also identified by the
recall order. Some researchers have noted that the PMI and UMI can be
stored in different brain areas. For example, a functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) study revealed stronger activations in the
posterior parietal cortex and inferior temporal cortex during PMI
retrieval, whereas the lateral prefrontal cortex was more active during
UMI retrieval (Nee & Jonides, 2011); Another study investigated their
neural representations and reported that PMIs can be decoded from a
wide range of areas, including visual, parietal, and prefrontal regions,
whereas UMIs can be decoded from only limited areas, such as the
intraparietal sulcus and the frontal eye field (Christophel et al., 2018).
However, some other researchers have suggested that the PMI and UMI
can be stored in the same area but in different formats (Lewis-Peacock
et al., 2012; Van Loon et al., 2018; Wan et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020; Yu &
Shim, 2017; J. Zhang et al., 2022). For example, studies have shown that
in the occipital region, the neural representation of the PMI can be
continuously decoded during maintenance, whereas the UMI represen­
tation rapidly returns to baseline levels (Lewis-Peacock et al., 2012; Yu
& Shim, 2017). Moreover, recent research has shown that the PMI and
UMI reveal opposite neural representational patterns in posterior areas
during VWM maintenance (Van Loon et al., 2018; Wan et al., 2020; Yu
et al., 2020). Additionally, recent electroencephalography (EEG) studies
have shown that the amplitude of contralateral delay activity (CDA),
which is thought to reflect the storage capacity, is related to the number
of PMIs but not UMIs (J. Zhang et al., 2022).
However, there is accumulating evidence against the independent
storage view, suggesting that information with varying priorities in­
teracts during VWM. For example, a recent study using a more sensitive
orientation delayed estimation task revealed that the recall of both PMIs
and UMIs was influenced by each other (Bae & Luck, 2017). The authors
found that PMIs and UMIs repelled each other when the angular dif­
ference between PMIs and UMIs was small while attracted each other
when the angular difference became larger. Researchers have suggested
that lateral inhibition occurs between PMIs and UMIs. Moreover, Bae’s
study noted that the recall of PMIs was less influenced by UMIs, and
posited a potential explanation that sustained attention to PMIs reduced
their susceptibility to UMI interference. However, in this study, PMIs
and UMIs were presented in the same location, which could introduce
perceptual-level interference (Shepherdson et al., 2022) and confound
the VWM-level interaction conclusions. Meanwhile, the total memory
load was under the memory capacity (around 4 items) and left the in­
fluence of memory load unclear. In addition, another study challenged
these findings by revealing that only the neural representations of UMIs
recovered to the original levels after a distracting stimulus was pre­
sented. Researchers have argued that the inactivity of a UMI’s neural
representation makes it less susceptible to interference (Mallett & LewisPeacock, 2019). Moreover, a series of recent neuroimaging studies also
have revealed that during PMI recall, the memory representations of
UMIs are reactivated (Muhle-Karbe et al., 2021; Pietrelli et al., 2022; Yu
et al., 2020), providing another perspective for understanding the un­
derlying mechanism of their interactions. In sum, this evidence suggests
that studies supporting the independent storage view may be due to
their insensitive experimental designs or mistakenly linking dissociated
neural activities to absent behavioral interference. Meanwhile, although
preliminary behavioral results indicated asymmetrical interaction be­
tween PMIs and UMIs, key questions like modulating factors and un­
derlying mechanisms remain unelucidated.
In the current study, we operationalized the state of memory items
based on their recall priorities: PMIs were the first-recalled items and
would be processed in an active state for the upcoming response, while
UMIs were the later-recalled items and would be stored in a relatively

passive state. In Experiment 1, participants performed a delayed recall
task for colors under different loads of PMIs and UMIs. We assessed the
interaction effects by comparing recall changes of the PMIs and UMIs
when the memory load of the other state increased. Next, we confirmed
that the interaction pattern was consistent across different sequence
orders (Experiments 2 and 3) and stimulus types (Experiments 4 and 5).
Finally, we verified that the sustained attention allocated to PMIs during
maintenance (Experiment 6) and the prioritized retrieval of PMIs
(Experiment 7) were responsible for the observed interaction patterns
between PMIs and UMIs. In these two experiments, although the ma­
nipulations introduced temporal state changes, we made the definitions
consistent given the core information flow were kept same and it would
be crucial to preserve the continuity across the study.
Experiment 1
Experiment 1 aimed to examine whether the PMIs and UMIs inter­
acted during VWM by testing whether the memory load of the PMIs
affected UMI recall and vice versa. The participants completed a delayed
recall task for colors, where they were required to recall two sequen­
tially presented color arrays. First, we tried to replicate that recall per­
formance of PMIs and UMIs decreased as their own load increased (i.e.,
the self-state load effect, Lewis-Peacock et al., 2012; Z. Li et al., 2021);
More importantly, we tested whether recall performance of the PMI and
UMI would deteriorate when the load of items in the other state
increased (i.e., another-state load effect). Furthermore, we examined if
the another-state load effect was different in PMIs and UMIs.
Participants
To determine the sample size, we entered the effect size of the
interaction effect between priority status and item load on recall per­
formance in a previous study (ηp2 = 0.545; Experiment 3 in Li et al.,
2021) into MorePower software (Campbell & Thompson, 2012), and a
sample size of 8 participants would provide power greater than 90 % for
detecting interaction of priority status and item load (α = 0.05). Based
on the results in power analysis and number of participants in previous
study with a similar design (Li et al., 2021, n = 30 in Experiment 3;
Myers et al., 2018, n = 24 in Experiment 1), we further increased the
sample size to 24 in the experiment to ensure the reliability of our
experiment.
Twenty-seven undergraduate and graduate students from Zhejiang
University participated in Experiment 1 (11 males; age: M = 19.13
years, SD = 1.62). All of the participants were right-handed, had normal
or corrected-to-normal vision, and had no color blindness or color
weakness. We excluded participants whose recall errors exceeded 3
standard deviations from the group mean, and 24 participants were
included. A unique set of participants was recruited for each experiment.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Zhejiang
University (2021–025), and participants provided informed consent
prior to the experiment and received monetary compensation (30 RMB/
hour) for the experiment.
Stimuli and procedure
The participants completed a delayed recall task for colors (Fig. 1; Li
et al., 2021; W. Zhang & Luck, 2008). In each trial, a 500 ms white
fixation (length = 0.75◦ , width = 0.05◦ ) appeared in the center of the
screen, and then the first color array was presented. The color array
consisted of 1, 2, or 3 colored dots (radius = 0.5◦ ). Three hundred and
sixty color values were sampled around a color circle in the CIE L*a*b
space, with the center at [50, 20, 20] and a radius of 60. In each trial, six
colors were randomly selected from these 360◦ color values, with a
minimum difference of 20◦ . Two sets of six positions from an invisible
ring centered at the screen (radius = 6◦ ; first set: 60◦ , 180◦ , 300◦ ; second
set: 120◦ , 240◦ , 360◦ ) were selected. On the basis of the number of items

Fig. 1. In the delayed estimation task for colors in the Experiment 1, participants were required to remember two subsequently-presented color arrays. The memory
load in the first and second color arrays was 1, 2, or 3. In the first probe display, participants always recalled the color at the targeted location in the second color
array; then they recalled another targeted color in the first color array. The figure showed an example where the memory loads in both the first and second color
arrays were 3.

in each color array, we then determined the colors and their presented
positions from the candidate colors and positions. Colors and positions
in the same trial were not repeated. Each color array lasted for 500 ms,
followed by an interval of 1500 ms where a fixation was centered on the
screen. Next, two probe displays were presented sequentially with an
interval of 800 ms, requiring participants to recall the colors of the cued
positions in the second and first color arrays. The probe display included
a color wheel, which was 0.5◦ thick, had a radius of 3◦ and was centered
on the screen. The participants were instructed to recall the targeted
color by moving the mouse and clicking the specific color along the color
wheel within a maximum response time of 8 s. The color distribution on
the wheel was randomized in each trial to prevent participants from
preparing their responses in advance.
The experiment included three memory loads for the PMI and UMI
(1, 2, or 3 items), and there were 40 trials per condition. All of the trials
were evenly and randomly divided into 10 blocks. At the beginning of
each block, a random four-digit number was presented, and the partic­
ipants were asked to verbally repeat it during the task to prevent po­
tential verbalization strategies (Shaffer & Shiffrin, 1972). The entire
experiment lasted for approximately 70 min. Before the formal experi­
ment began, each participant completed 36 practice trials to ensure that
they were familiar with the procedure.
The experimental program was written using MATLAB scripts in
combination with Psychtoolbox-3. All stimuli were presented on a 19inch LCD monitor (60 Hz refresh rate, 1920 × 1080 pixels) using
MATLAB R2020a software. The participants viewed the screen from a
distance of 80 cm, and the background color of the screen was set to
black (RGB = [0, 0, 0]) throughout the experiment to avoid potential
visual distractions.

Results
Three-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed no three-way inter­
action (F(4,92) = 1.846, p = 0.110, ηp2 = 0.078, BF = 0.994), but sig­
nificant two-way interactions between the priority state and self-state
load (F(2,46) = 15.354, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.400, BF > 1000), as well as
between the priority state and another-state load (F(2,46) = 20.570, p <
0.001, ηp2 = 0.472, BF > 1000). To examine the interaction between the
priority state and self-state load, further one-way repeated measures
ANOVAs and post hoc test results indicated that as the self-state load
increased, the recall errors for both PMIs and UMIs worsened (one-way
ANOVAs: Fs > 89.043, ps < 0.001, ηp2s > 0.795, BFs > 1000; post hoc
tests: ts > 7.680 ps < 0.001, Cohen’s ds > 0.756, BFs > 1000; Fig. 2B,
left). Meanwhile, paired t tests on fitting slopes revealed that the degree
of UMI influenced by the self-state load was significantly greater than
that of PMI (t(23) = 4.811, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.982, BF = 351.956;
both slopes were greater than 0: ts > 10.152, ps < 0.001, Cohen’s ds >
2.072, BFs > 1000; Fig. 2B, right). These results indicated that our
sequential recall task effectively modulated the priority state.
More importantly, to clarify the interaction between the priority
state and another-state load, one-way repeated-measures ANOVA
revealed that there were significant differences in recall errors for both
the PMI and UMI as the another-state load increased (Fs > 3.230, ps <
0.049, ηp2s > 0.123, BFs > 1.244), and the post hoc test results revealed
that the PMI recall errors significantly worsened under larger UMI loads
(UMI load 1 vs. 2: t(23) = 0.356, p = 1.000, Cohen’s d = 0.062, BF =
0.227; UMI load 2 vs. 3, t (23) = 2.815, p = 0.029, Cohen’s d = 0.296, BF
= 4.913), whereas the UMI recall errors significantly worsened under
higher PMI loads (PMI load 1 vs. 2: t(23) = 8.092, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d
= 0.760, BF ≥ 1000; PMI load 2 vs. 3: t(23) = 2.217, p = 0.110, Cohen’s
d = 0.204, BF = 1.659; Fig. 2C, left). Consistently, paired t tests on slopes
also revealed that the degree to which UMI was influenced by PMI was
significantly greater than the degree to which PMI was influenced by
UMI (t(23) = 4.967, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.014, BF = 499.002; both
fitted slopes were greater than 0: ts > 2.477, ps < 0.021, Cohen’s ds >
0.506, BF > 2.613; Fig. 2C, right). These results demonstrated an
asymmetrical interaction pattern between PMIs and UMIs. Moreover,
additional paired t tests on the slopes revealed that for both the PMI and
UMI recalls, the degrees of self-state load effects were significantly
stronger than those of the another-state load effects (ts > 5.679, ps <
0.001, Cohen’s ds > 1.159; BF > 1000), confirming that PMIs and UMIs
were stored in different formats, with the distinction being qualitative
rather than quantitative.

Data analysis
The recall error was estimated by the angular difference on the color
wheel between the selected color and the target color (in degrees). The
errors in the first and second recalls indicated the performance of the
PMI and UMI, respectively (Fig. 2A).
To examine whether the recall performance for the PMI and UMI was
influenced by the memory load of the same and different priority states,
we conducted a 2 (recall priority: UMI vs. PMI) × 3 (self-state load: 1 vs.
2 vs. 3 items) × 3 (another-state load: 1 vs. 2 vs. 3 items) three-way
repeated-measures ANOVA. If the three-way interaction was signifi­
cant, we would examine the interaction effects between the self-state
load and another-state load on PMI and UMI recall separately via twoway repeated-measures ANOVA. If the three-way interaction was not
significant, we would specifically examine the interactions between
recall priority and self-state load, as well as interactions between recall
priority and another-state load. In the case of significant two-way in­
teractions, we further conducted simple effect analyses and post hoc
tests. All post hoc tests in this study were corrected via Bonferroni ad­
justments. Moreover, we performed parallel Bayesian analyses via
standard priors, as implemented in JASP Version 0.16.3. All of the sta­
tistical analyses were performed in MATLAB and JASP software.
Previous studies have reported that recall errors for PMIs are lower
than those for UMIs (Bae & Luck, 2017; Z. Li et al., 2021; Oberauer,
2005; Peters et al., 2012). To rule out the possibility that recall baselines
influenced interaction patterns between PMIs and UMIs, we assessed the
overall magnitude of their interaction effects using linear regression
analysis. To achieve this, at the individual level, we conducted linear
regression analyses with PMI and UMI recall errors as dependent vari­
ables and self-state load and another-state load as independent vari­
ables. The slope values of the linear fits indicated the degree to which
the PMIs and UMIs were affected by the self-state load or another-state
load. Next, we tested the significance of the slopes via one-sample t tests
and compared the degree to which the PMI and UMI were affected by the
self-state load and another-state load using paired t tests.

Summary of Experiment 1
Experiment 1 replicated previous findings that recall errors for both
PMIs and UMIs are influenced by self-state load (Lewis-Peacock et al.,
2012; Z. Li et al., 2021). More importantly, we found that the recall
errors for both the PMIs and UMIs deteriorated when the another-state
load increased, indicating considerable interactions between items
with varying priorities in VWM. Additionally, we found that these
interactive effects were asymmetric, with UMI recall being more
affected by PMI than the opposite. In the following experiments, we
focused on the interaction patterns between PMIs and UMIs during
VWM.
Experiments 2 and 3
Experiments 2 and 3 further examined whether the presentation
order of PMIs and UMIs influenced the interaction between them. In
Experiment 2, we reversed the presentation order of the PMIs and UMIs;
in Experiment 3, we randomized the presentation order by introducing a
post encoding cue. The other settings were the same as those in Exper­
iment 1. If the interaction pattern was not influenced by the presentation
order, we would observe similar results in Experiments 2 and 3.

Experiment 2

measures ANOVA revealed that both the PMI and UMI recall errors
changed significantly across the another-state loads (Fs > 8.259, ps <
0.001, ηp2s > 0.264, BFs > 34.58; Fig. 3C, left). Post hoc tests revealed
that as the another-state load increased, PMI recall errors significantly
increased only between the lowest two UMI load levels (UMI load 1 vs.
2: t(23) = 4.240, p = 0.003, Cohen’s d = 0.295, BF = 38.271; UMI load 2
vs. 3: t(23) = 0.941, p = 1.000, Cohen’s d = 0.066, BF = 0.264), whereas
UMI recall errors significantly increased as the PMI load gradually
increased (ts > 6.776, ps < 0.001, Cohen’s ds > 0.732, BFs > 1000).
Moreover, a paired t test of the slopes indicated that the degree of the
another-state load effect on the UMI was greater than that on the PMI (t
(23) = 6.847, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.398, BF > 1000; both slopes were
greater than 0, ts > 3.339, ps < 0.003, Cohen’s ds > 0.682, BFs > 14.120;
Fig. 3C, right). These results replicated the asymmetrical interaction
pattern and indicated a larger influence of PMIs on UMIs.

Participants and procedure
The sample size of participants and selection criteria were consistent
with those in Experiment 1; Experiment 2 included 24 participants (10
males; age: M = 22.17 years, SD = 3.07). The stimulus materials and
task procedures used in Experiment 2 were similar to those used in
Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, the only difference was that the recall
order of two color arrays was reversed, requiring participants to first
recall one targeted color from the first array and then another from the
second array (Fig. 3A).
Data analysis
The data analysis was identical to that in Experiment 1 while we only
focused on the another-load effect (a.k.a. the interaction effect between
priority state and another-state load). The recall error in the first recall
reflects the performance of the PMI, and the recall error in the second
recall reflects the performance of the UMI.

Experiment 3
Participants and procedure
The sample size of participants and selection criteria were consistent
with those in Experiment 1; Experiment 3 included 24 participants (9
males; age: M = 20.58 years, SD = 2.28). The stimulus materials and task
procedures used in Experiment 3 were similar to those used in Experi­
ment 1. The only difference was that the recall order was determined by
a numerical cue presented after the second color array, with “1″ indi­
cating that participants first recalled colors from the first color array and
then from the second array, whereas ”2″ indicating the opposite recall
order. The numerical cue was presented for 200 ms, and the

Results
Consistent with the results of Experiment 1, the three-way interac­
tion effect between the priority state, self-state load and another-state
load was not significant (F(4,92) = 1.304, p = 0.274, ηp2 = 0.054, BF
= 0.274). However, all two-way interactions were significant (Fs >
3.086, ps < 0.020, ηp2s > 0.118, BFs > 1.662). Focusing on the inter­
action between priority state and another-state load, one-way repeated-

probabilities of the two recall orders were equal (Fig. 4A).

p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.082, BF ≥ 1000; both slopes were greater than
0, ts > 4.188, ps < 0.001, Cohen’s ds > 0.855, BF > 87.911; Fig. 4C,
right).
Additionally, there was no significant three-way interaction between
priority states, another-state loads, and presentation orders (F(4,138) =
2.126, p = 0.081, ηp2 = 0.058, BF = 0.260), suggesting comparable
interaction effects across three experiments with varying presentation
orders of PMIs and UMIs.

Data analysis
The data analysis was identical to that in Experiment 2. Furthermore,
we performed an analysis to further assess the asymmetric interaction
effects across Experiments 1 to 3. Based on the three-way repeatedmeasures ANOVAs, we add a between-subject factor presentation order
of PMIs and UMIs (Experiment 1-backward recall vs. Experiment2forward recall vs. Experiment 3- random recall order) into this analysis.

Summary of Experiments 2 and 3
Both Experiments 2 and 3 replicated the main findings of Experiment
1: the interactive effects between the PMI and UMI memory were sig­
nificant, and the UMI was more significantly affected by the PMI than
was the opposite. These results suggested that the representation order
of the PMI and UMI did not affect the pattern of their interactions. The
different interactive effects between PMI and UMI under low and high
memory loads in Experiments 2 and 3 are discussed further in the gen­
eral discussion section.

Results
Similar three-way ANOVA results with Experiment 1 were observed:
There was no three-way interaction effect (F(4,92) = 1.994, p = 0.102,
ηp2 = 0.080, BF = 1.371), but all two-way interactions were significant
(Fs > 17.505, ps < 0.001, ηp2s > 0.432, BFs > 1000). Focusing on the
interaction effect between priority state and another-state load, further
one-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that both the PMI and
UMI recall errors changed across the another-state loads (Fs > 9.982, ps
< 0.001, ηp2s > 0.303, BFs > 99; Fig. 4C, left). Post hoc tests revealed
that as the another-state load increased, PMI recall errors increased only
between lower UMI loads (UMI load 1 vs. 2: t(23) = 3.130, p = 0.014,
Cohen’s d = 0.363, BF = 9.180; UMI load 2 vs. 3: t(23) = 1.139, p =
0.799, Cohen’s d = 0.123, BF = 0.383), whereas UMI recall errors
significantly increased as the another-state load gradually increased (ts
> 2.739, ps < 0.035, Cohen’s ds > 0.320, BFs > 4.251). Moreover, a
paired t test of the slopes revealed that UMI recall errors were more
significantly influenced by the PMI load than vice versa (t(23) = 5.300,

Experiments 4 and 5
To investigate whether the interaction pattern between different
types of priority information is consistent across different stimulus
types, Experiments 4 and 5 employed delayed estimation tasks for ori­

action patterns.

interaction effect between the priority state and the another-state load (F
(2,46) = 22.431, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.494, BF > 1000), with no three-way
interaction or other two-way interactions (Fs < 1.267, ps > 0.289, ηp2s
< 0.052, BFs < 0.246). Accordingly, the following one-way repeated
measures ANOVAs and post hoc tests revealed that both the PMI and
UMI recall errors increased as the another-state load gradually increased
(one-way ANOVAs: Fs > 20.071, ps < 0.001, ηp2s > 0.466, BFs > 1000;
post hoc tests: ps < 0.035, Cohen’s ds > 0.227, BFs ≥ 4.290; Fig. 5C,
left). Additionally, a paired t test of the slopes revealed that the UMI was
more strongly affected by the PMI than vice versa (t(23) = 5.971, p <
0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.219, BF ≥ 1000; both slopes were greater than 0: ts
> 5.590, ps < 0.001, Cohen’s ds > 1.141, BFs > 1000; Fig. 5C, right).

Participants and procedure
The sample size of participants and selection criteria were consistent
with those used in Experiment 1. Experiment 4 included 24 participants
(12 males; age: M = 21.92 years, SD = 2.69). Participants completed a
delayed recall task for orientations. In each trial, six orientations were
randomly selected from 0◦ to 180◦ , with a minimum difference of 10◦ .
The orientations were presented as white lines (1.5◦ in length, 0.1◦ in
width). The positions where the orientations were presented were the
same as those in Experiment 3. In the two test phases, participants were
required to recall the orientation at the cued positions. On the probe
display, a randomly oriented white line was presented at the center of
the screen, and participants adjusted its orientation using the mouse and
then confirmed the response by clicking the left button. The initial angle
of the white line was randomized in each trial to prevent advance
preparation (Fig. 5A).

Experiment 5
Participants and procedure
The sample size of participants and selection criteria were consistent
with those used in Experiment 1. Experiment 5 included 24 participants
(7 males, M = 22.08 years, SD = 2.21).
Participants completed a delayed estimation task for locations. The
only difference from Experiment 3 was that participants had to recall the
previously presented locations during the test phase on the basis of the
colored cues. To achieve this, the colors and positions of the stimuli were
adjusted accordingly. In all of the trials, the colors of the two memory
arrays were fixed and selected from the same color wheel: 60◦ , 180◦ , and
300◦ for one array and 120◦ , 240◦ , and 360◦ for the other; then, the
positions were randomly selected from the same invisible circle, with a
minimum difference of 20◦ . During the test phases, colored cues were

Data analysis
The recall errors for orientations were defined as the different angles
(in degrees) between the selected values and the targeted values. The
data analysis procedure was the same as that in Experiment 3.
Results
The orientation task revealed a similar interaction pattern as the
three experiments above. Three-way ANOVA revealed significant

response wheel was displayed (radius = 3◦ , width = 0.5◦ ). The partici­
pants recalled the position of the cued colors by moving the mouse
around the response wheel, with a white dot indicating the mouse’s
corresponding position (radius = 0.5◦ ). The participants confirmed their
selection by clicking the left mouse button. The initial position of the
white dot was randomly set in each trial to prevent advance preparation

repeated measures ANOVAs to test the interaction effects between the
priority state and another-state load. The results revealed that when the
self-state load was 1, although the main effects of the priority state and
the another-state load were significant (Fs > 16.496, ps < 0.001, ηp2s >
0.418, BFs > 100), there was no interaction effect between them (F
(2,46) = 0.957, p = 0.392, ηp2 = 0.040, BF = 0.297; Fig. 6C, left). Oneway repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that both the PMI and UMI
recall errors changed as the another-state load increased (Fs > 7.491, ps
< 0.002, ηp2s > 0.246, BFs > 35.366). Post hoc tests revealed that PMI
recall errors tended to increase with increasing UMI load but were not
statistically significant (load 1 vs. load 2: t(23) = 2.514, p = 0.058,
Cohen’s d = 0.486, BF = 2.793; load 2 vs. load 3: t(23) = 1.786, p =
0.262, Cohen’s d = 0.485, BF = 0.845), and UMI recall errors followed a
similar pattern (load 1 vs. load 2: t(23) = 2.246, p = 0.104, Cohen’s d =
0.487, BF = 1.743; load 2 vs. load 3: t(23) = 3.124, p = 0.014, Cohen’s d
= 0.638, BF = 9.060). Consistently, paired t tests revealed no difference
between the influences of the PMI on the UMI and those of the UMI on
the PMI (t(23) = 1.893, p = 0.071, Cohen’s d = 0.387, BF = 0.990; both
slopes greater than 0: ts > 2.922, ps < 0.008, Cohen’s ds > 0.597, BFs ≥
6.058).
In contrast, when the self-state load was 2 or 3, the interaction pat­
terns between the PMI and UMI were consistent with those of previous
experiments, showing significant interaction effects between the prior­
ity state and the other-state load (Fs > 5.907, ps < 0.005; ηp2s > 0.204;
BFs > 15.486). Simple effects analysis and post hoc tests revealed that
both PMI and UMI recall errors significantly increased as the anotherstate load gradually increased (one-way ANOVA: Fs > 17.610, ps <
0.001, ηp2s > 0.434, BFs > 1000; post hoc t test: ts > 2.639, ps < 0.044,
Cohen’s d > 0.492; BFs ≥ 3.514; except for PMI recall errors, the PMI
load was 2, UMI load 2 vs. load 3: t(23) = 2.161, p = 0.124, Cohen’s d =
0.525, BF = 1.512). Additionally, a paired t test of the slopes revealed
that the UMI was significantly more affected by the PMI than the
opposite way was (ts > 3.204, ps < 0.004, Cohen’s ds > 0.654, BFs ≥

Data analysis
The recall errors for locations were defined as the different angles (in
degrees) between the selected values and the targeted values. The data
analysis procedure was the same as that in Experiment 3. Furthermore,
we performed a four-way repeated-measures ANOVA to compare the
another-state load effects across Experiments 3 to 5. To achieve this,
based on the three-way repeated-measures ANOVAs in each experiment,
we added a between-subject factor stimuli type (Experiment 3: color
recall vs. Experiment 4: orientation recall vs. Experiment 5: location
recall). Given the non-uniform error scales (color/location errors ranged
0–180◦ due to unique dot values, while orientation errors ranged 0–90◦
due to circular angle representation), color/location errors were divided
by two to ensure cross-experimental consistency and mitigate statistical
biases.
Results
The location task also replicated the main findings of the three ex­
periments above, although there was a slight difference. Three-way
repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant interaction effect be­
tween the priority state, self-state load and another-state load (F(4,92)
= 3.915, p = 0.006, ηp2 = 0.145, BF = 17.435). Since we focused on the
another-state load effect, at each self-load level, we conducted two-way

1.075, BFs ≥ 971.071; Fig. 6C, right).
Finally, there was no significant three-way interaction between pri­
ority states, another-state loads, and stimuli types (F(4,138) = 0.682, p

effects across the experiments with varying stimuli types.

the A or D key, with a maximum response time of 2 s. The keys were
counterbalanced across participants. Moreover, the memory loads of
PMIs and UMIs could be 1 or 2. Thus, in the Experiment 6, we included 8
conditions, and each condition included 40 trials. All trials were evenly
and randomly distributed into 10 blocks. The experiment lasted for
approximately 80 min.

Summary of Experiments 4 and 5

Data analysis

Experiments 4 and 5 verified that the asymmetry interaction pattern
between PMIs and UMIs is consistent across different stimulus types.
Notably, this pattern was similar across memory loads in color and
orientation recalls but became more pronounced under higher loads in
location recall. We explore potential reasons for these differences in the
discussion section.

The accuracy rate in arithmetic judgments validated the attentionswitching manipulation (mean accuracy = 70.90 %, SD = 7.37 %, one
sample t-test versus chance level is significant, t(17) = 12.023, p <
0.001, Cohen’s d = 2.834; BF ≥ 1000). The color recall error reflects the
VWM performance. First, we performed similar three-factor repeated
measures ANOVAs and statistical procedures in the attention-stay and
attention-switch conditions separately. We still focused on the interac­
tion between priority states and another-state load, and paired t-tests
were conducted in each priority state if it was significant (since only two
memory loads were included in this experiment). If different interaction
patterns between the PMI and UMI were observed in the two attention
conditions, we would then conduct a four-way repeated-measures
ANOVA [2 (attention condition: attention stay vs. attention switch) × 2
(priority state: UMI vs. PMI) × 2 (self-state load: 1 vs. 2) × 2 (anotherstate load: 1 vs. 2)] to further confirm whether the differences were
significant. Moreover, we performed a similar linear fit analysis of recall
errors and further conducted a two-way ANOVA [2 (attention condition:
attention stay vs. attention switch) × 2 (another-load effect: PMI
affected by UMI vs. UMI affected by PMI)] to examine whether the
interaction effects differed significantly between attention conditions.

Experiments 6 and 7
Through the above experiments, we have provided strong evidence
of the asymmetric interaction effects between PMIs and UMIs during
VWM. However, the underlying cognitive mechanisms remain unclear.
One view proposed that the asymmetry interactions occurred since more
attentional resources were allocated to PMIs during the delay phase,
reducing its susceptibility to interference (Bae & Luck, 2017). Another
view suggested that the reactivation of UMI representations during PMI
retrieval affects UMI recall, leading to a unidirectional influence (MuhleKarbe et al., 2021). We tested these two hypotheses in Experiment 6 and
Experiment 7 separately. The experimental designs leveraged that in
Experiment 1, which showed the strongest interaction between priority
status and another-state load.

Results

Experiment 6

We replicated the results of Experiment 1 under the attention stay
condition. The three-way ANOVA revealed significant two-way in­
teractions between the priority state and another-state load, as well as
between another-state load and self-state load (Fs > 6.243, ps < 0.023,
ηp2s > 0.269, BFs > 2.602), but no three-way interaction or two-way
interaction between the priority state and self-state load (Fs < 2.943,
ps > 0.104, ηp2s < 0.104, BFs < 1.392). Then, further paired t tests
revealed that UMI recall error significantly increased when the PMI load
increased (t(17) = 5.032, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.186; BF = 275.714),
but no difference was detected in the opposite condition (t(17) = 1.088,
p = 0.292, Cohen’s d = 0.257, BF = 0.407; Fig. 7C, left). Consistently,
paired t tests on the slopes revealed that the another-load effect on UMI
was significantly greater than that on PMI (t(17) = 3.839, p = 0.001,
Cohen’s d = 0.905, BF = 29.533; the UMI slope was greater than 0:t(17)
= 4.695, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.107, BF = 147.313; and the PMI slope
was not different from 0: t(17) = 1.032, p = 0.317, Cohen’s d = 0.243,
BF = 0.387; Fig. 7C, right). In contrast, as expected, under the attention
switch condition, there were no three-way interaction or two-way in­
teractions (Fs < 2.087, ps > 0.167, ηp2s < 0.108, BFs < 0.729; Fig. 7C,
left), but significant main effects of self-state load and another-state load
(Fs > 15.900, ps < 0.001, ηp2s > 0.483, BFs > 21.418). Paired t tests
revealed that both the PMI and UMI recall errors increased when the
another-state memory load increased (ts > 2.937, ps < 0.009, Cohen’s
ds > 0.692, BFs > 5.662; Fig. 7C, right). Similarly, paired t tests on the
slopes revealed no difference in the degrees of the another-state loads on
the PMIs and UMIs (t(17) = 0.017, p = 0.987, Cohen’s d = 0.004, BF =
0.243; the slopes were all greater than 0: ts > 3.297, ps < 0.004, Cohen’s
ds > 0.777, BFs > 10.819; Fig. 7C, right).
More importantly, the four-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed
significant three-way interactions between attention condition, priority
state and another-state load, as well as attention condition, another-state
load and self-state load (Fs > 4.779, ps < 0.043, ηp2s > 0.219, BFs >
1.677, no other interactions were significant: Fs < 4.008, ps > 0.062,
ηp2s > 0.191, BFs < 1.109). Additionally, a two-way ANOVA of the

In Experiment 6, participated need to complete a math distracting
task during the maintenance. This attention-shift manipulation tempo­
rally withdraws both PMIs and UMIs out of attention and introduces
similar passive states. If the sustained attention to PMIs drives the
asymmetric interactions, comparing with the attention-stay condition
without distractors, we would expect an increased influence of UMIs on
PMIs under the attention-shift condition and thus a less asymmetrical
interaction, we kept the terms of PMIs and UMIs across experimental
conditions since the recall priorities did not change and the comparisons
between conditions would be clearer.
Participants
To determine the sample size, we entered the effect size of the
interaction effect between priority status and the another-state load in
Experiment 1 (ηp2 = 0.421) into MorePower software, and a sample size
of 18 participants would provide power greater than 90 % to replicate
the interaction effect (α = 0.05). The inclusion and screening criteria for
participants were consistent with those of the previous experiments.
Eighteen participants were included in Experiment 6 (5 males; age: M =
22.56 years, SD = 4.23).
Procedure
The procedure was similar to that in Experiment 1 except that we
included two attention conditions (Fig. 7A). In half of the trials,
consistent with the regular experimental procedure in Experiment 1,
during the 2 s delay after the second color array, the participants only
needed to look at the fixation at the center of the screen (“attention
stay”). In the other half of the trials, the participants were required to
complete a single-digit addition or subtraction task during this delay
period (“attention switch”). In these attention switch trials, the partic­
ipants judged whether the presented equation was correct by pressing

slopes revealed a significant interaction between the attention condition
and the another-load effect (F(1,17) = 5.765, p = 0.028, ηp2 = 0.253, BF
= 5.472; Fig. 7C, right). Further paired t tests revealed that, compared
with the attention stay condition, the another-load effect on the PMI
specifically increased under the attention switch condition (t(17) =
4.084, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.963, BF = 46.780; the another-load
effect on the UMI did not change: t(17) = 0.203, p = 0.842, Cohen’s
d = 0.048; BF = 0.248). These results confirmed that the asymmetry
interaction effects were a result of sustained attention to the PMI and
that the PMI was less affected by UMI.

Results
Similarly, we replicated the results of Experiment 1 in the doublerecall trials. A three-factor repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that
two-way interactions between priority state and another-state load (F
(1,17) = 12.848, p = 0.002, ηp2 = 0.430, BF = 12.516), as well as those
between priority state and self-state load, were significant (F(1,17) =
8.595, p = 0.009, ηp2 = 0.336, BF = 1.424; other interaction effects: Fs <
0.107, ps > 0.748, ηp2s < 0.006, BFs < 0.332). Further paired t tests
revealed that the UMI recall error significantly increased with increasing
PMI load (t(21) = 4.532, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.068; BF = 129.626),
whereas the PMI recall error did not change when the UMI load
increased (t(17) = 1.859, p = 0.080, Cohen’s d = 0.438, BF = 0.538;
Fig. 8C, left). Similarly, paired t tests on the slopes revealed that the
another-load effect on UMI was significantly greater than that on PMI (t
(17) = 3.644, p = 0.002, Cohen’s d = 0.859, BF = 20.496; on UMI: t(17)
= 4.821, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.136, BF = 186.412; on PMI: t(17) =
1.555, p = 0.138, Cohen’s d = 0.366, BF = 0.672; Fig. 8C, right). In
contrast, in the single-recall condition, except for a significant two-way
interaction between priority state and self-state load (F(1,17) = 6.849, p
= 0.018, ηp2 = 0.287, BF = 1.344), the other interaction effects were not
significant (Fs < 2.017, ps > 0.174, ηp2s < 0.106, BFs < 1.849). Further
paired t tests revealed that neither the PMI nor the UMI recall errors
changed when the another-state load increased (ts < 1.577, ps > 0.133,
Cohen’s d < 0.356, BFs < 0.691; Fig. 8C, left). Similarly, the comparison
of slopes revealed that there were no significant another-load effects on
the PMI or UMI (ts < 1.630, ps > 0.121, Cohen’s ds < 0.384, BFs <
0.738; difference: t(17) = 0.136, p = 0.894, Cohen’s d = 0.032, BF =
0.245; Fig. 8C, right).
Moreover, the four-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed signif­
icant three-way interactions between the recall condition, priority state
and another-state load, as well as between the recall condition, priority
state and self-state load (Fs > 6.112, ps < 0.024, ηp2s > 0.264, BFs >
3.240; other interaction effects: Fs < 0.981, ps > 0.336, ηp2s < 0.055,
BFs < 0.510). Moreover, two-way ANOVA of the slopes revealed a sig­
nificant interaction effect (F(1,17) = 5.790, p = 0.028, ηp2 = 0.254, BF =
24.087). Further paired t tests revealed that the another-load effect on
UMI specifically decreased in the double-recall condition compared with
that in the single-recall condition (t(17) = 3.189, p = 0.005, Cohen’s d =
0.752, BF = 8.879; no changes in the another-load effect on PMI were
detected: t(17) = 0.272, p = 0.789, Cohen’s d = 0.064, BF = 0.251;
Fig. 8C, right). These results suggested that the priority retrieval of the
prioritized set contributes to the greater influence of the PMI on the UMI
than that of the UMI on the PMI.

Experiment 7
In Experiment 7, participated completed an additional single-recall
condition where only PMIs or UMIs were recalled. If the prioritized
retrieval of PMIs contributed to the asymmetrical interaction, we would
expect that the influence of the PMI on the UMI specifically decrease
when PMI recall was not needed. As a result, the asymmetry interaction
effects reduced.
Participants
The sample size of participants and selection criteria were consistent
with those used in Experiment 6. Eighteen participants were included in
Experiment 7 (4 males, age: M = 21.61 years, SD = 2.20).
Procedure
The procedure was similar to that of Experiment 1 except that we
included two recall conditions. In both conditions, participants encoded
two memory arrays with the instructions that the second memory array
was always first-recalled (PMIs) and the first memory array would be
later-recalled (UMIs). Then, after the delay following the second mem­
ory array display, different types of recall trials were randomly pre­
sented: In the double recall condition, consistent with previous
experiments, participants recalled the PMI and UMI sequentially
(“double recall: PMI & UMI”). In the single recall condition, participants
needed to recall only the PMI or UMI (“single recall: PMI” or “single
recall: UMI” in 50 % chance). In the single recall PMI trials, the par­
ticipants recalled the targeted colors from the second memory array
when the probe display appeared, and no responses were required in the
following waiting display, where a white dot (radius = 0.5◦ ) was pre­
sented for 2 s; In the single recall UMI trials, the same white dot waiting
display was first presented for 2 s, and then the participants needed to
recall the targeted colors from the first memory array when the
following probe display appeared (Fig. 8A). Notably, the 2 s interval was
based on the mean recall RT of PMIs in Experiment 1 to minimize the
potential influence of different delay durations (the actual RTs for PMIs
in two conditions were comparable to, and not significantly different
from, 2 s, ps > 0.05); and the waiting display omitted the response wheel
to prevent potential spontaneous retrieval processes.

Summary of Experiments 6 and 7
The results of Experiment 6 indicated that the smaller influence of
UMI on PMI was due to the protective effect of sustained attention on
PMI during the delay phase, which reduced its susceptibility to UMI.
Moreover, the results of Experiment 7 indicated that the greater influ­
ence of the PMI on the UMI was due to the prioritized retrieval of the
PMI, which increased the interference from the PMI unidirectionally.
Together, both the sustained attention to PMIs and the prioritized
retrieval of PMIs were responsible for the asymmetric interaction effects
between the PMI and UMI during VWM.
Notably, Experiment 6 revealed comparable recall performance be­
tween PMIs and UMIs following the distractor task, alongside

Data analysis
The data analysis in Experiment 7 was similar to that of Experiment
6, and we examined whether the interaction patterns differed between
the double-recall and single-recall conditions.

Fig. 8. A. The procedure of Experiment 7. In Experiment 7, participants sequentially recall colors from two memory arrays under the double recall condition,
whereas participants only recall one memory array under the single recall condition. Three types of trials are equally and randomly presented during the task, and the
PMIs and UMIs are 1 or 2. B. Recall errors for PMIs and UMIs under different memory load conditions. C. Another-state load effects on PMI and UMI recall. In panel C,
the left figures show changes in PMI and UMI recall errors under different another-state memory load conditions. Black asterisks represent significant interaction
effect and gray asterisks represent significant one-way ANOVAs. The right figures show the fitted slopes of the another-state memory load effects on PMI and UMI
recall. Black asterisks represent significant paired t-tests, and gray asterisks represent significant single-sample t-tests. Error bars represent standard errors (SE). ***p

comparable another-load effects of PMIs and UMIs — a pattern seem­
ingly inconsistent with Experiment 7′s demonstration that PMI retrieval
evoked extra interference on UMIs. We reconcile these outcomes
through differential pre-recall states of PMIs: In Experiment 6, the
arithmetic task disrupted sustained attention to PMIs, inducing tempo­
rally pre-recall passive states and resulting in a passive-state retrieval for
PMIs. In contrast, in Experiment 7, PMIs sustained in active states before
retrieval, leading to an active-state retrieval. This dissociation demon­
strates that, although PMI retrievals occur in both experiments, only
active-state retrieval of PMIs interferes with UMIs and drives the
asymmetric interaction pattern. Aligning with this interpretation,
studies have demonstrated that only PMIs could be reactivated by visual
impulses (Wolff et al., 2015) and neural modulations (Rose et al., 2016)
during the maintenance before recall, indicating that pre-recall storage
states lead to different retrieval processes. Critically, recent evidence
supported the interference effect of active-state retrieval: neural reac­
tivations of UMIs during PMI recall were observed (Muhle-Karbe et al.,
2021), and PMI reactivations after visual impulses correlated with
impaired UMI recall (Yang et al., 2025). Nevertheless, the consequences
of retrieval from (temporally) passive states remain underexplored and
warrant further investigation.

Furthermore, our study revealed that the interaction pattern was
asymmetrical, with a greater influence of PMIs on UMIs. This asym­
metric interaction pattern has been also noted by an earlier study (Bae &
Luck, 2017), and our study advanced their findings from the perspective
of larger another-state load effects, and extended the asymmetrical
interaction to the memory load exceeding memory capacity. More
critically, we demonstrated that shifting attention specifically increased
the influence of UMIs on PMIs, directly verifying the attention allocation
hypothesis. This result was also consistent with previous findings that
items allocated more attention would experience less interference. For
example, one study reported that neither the performance of the PMI nor
the VWM-related EEG indices (such as CDA) changed with UMI loads
(Heuer & Schubö, 2016). However, these findings were challenged by
other studies. For example, another study reported that a task-irrelevant
stimulus during maintenance had a larger negative impact on the PMI
than the UMI (Allen & Ueno, 2018; Hu et al., 2016). We proposed that
these inconsistencies could be explained when we distinguished taskirrelevant interference on PMIs and UMIs from the mutual influence
between PMIs and UMIs, which deserves more attention in future
studies.
Besides, we confirmed that prioritized PMI retrieval was also
responsible for the asymmetric interactions, which additionally
increased the impacts of the PMI on the UMI. Since the priority of items
was determined by response orders in most studies, the prioritized
retrieval of PMIs may unidirectionally affect UMIs. Our study verified
this hypothesis by demonstrating that the influence of PMIs on UMIs
specifically decreased in trials where PMIs were not recalled. While
other components of the testing window, such as test duration or probe
interference, may also contribute to the worsened performance for UMI,
the specific pattern of results observed in our study suggests that the
prioritized retrieval of PMIs plays a critical role in the asymmetric
interaction effects. Consistently, recent neuroimaging evidence has
revealed neural representations of UMIs during PMI recall, confirming
the “reactivation” of UMIs (Muhle-Karbe et al., 2021). Moreover, the
latest study revealed that, visual impulses evoked neural reactivations of
VWM, and larger reactivations were correlated with worse recall for
both PMIs and UMIs (Yang et al., 2025). These researchers proposed that
the neural reactivations weakened the neural dynamic representations,
which have been proven to be beneficial for VWM, impairing the VWM
performance (Liu et al., 2020). Moreover, our findings were consistent
with studies that reported output interference in previous studies. For
example, WM studies demonstrated large primacy effects in the serial
recall for verbal stimuli (Cowan et al., 2002; Cowan & Elliott, 2023), and
another study reported similar effects in long-term memory recall tasks
(Bartsch & Oberauer, 2023). Notably, although both retrieval interfer­
ence and attention allocation bias contribute to the asymmetrical
interaction between PMIs and UMIs, they operate in separated ways.
Finally, although the overall interactions between PMIs and UMIs
were consistent across presentation orders and stimuli, there were some
distinctions. Regarding different presentation orders, when PMIs were
first encoded, PMIs were more affected by UMIs when UMI loads were
high, whereas UMIs were more affected by PMIs when PMI loads were
low. In contrast, when PMIs were encoded later or the encoded orders
were randomized, PMIs were more affected when UMI loads were low,
whereas UMIs were affected regardless of PMI loads. These in­
consistencies may be explained by memory strategies. Specifically,
when PMIs were presented first, the memory state of both PMIs and
UMIs underwent at least one priority shift (since UMIs must be in the

General discussion
Our study revealed asymmetrical interactions between PMIs and
UMIs during VWM and clarified its underlying cognitive mechanism.
That is, the degree to which PMIs affected UMIs during VWM was
greater than the opposite, and this pattern was consistent across pre­
sentation orders and stimulus types. Moreover, the sustained attention
allocation to PMIs during maintenance and the prioritized PMI retrieval
were responsible for the observed asymmetric interactions, with the
former increased the influence of UMIs on PMIs and the latter decreased
the influence of PMIs on UMIs.
First, we found that UMI recall deteriorated when the PMI load
increased and vice versa, providing direct evidence for the interactions
between information with varying priorities during VWM. These find­
ings are consistent with previous studies (Bae & Luck, 2017). Compared
with Bae’s study, on the one hand, PMIs and UMIs in the current study
did not overlap in terms of location, ruling out the potential explanation
that the observed interaction effects were caused only by the shared
locations at the perceptual level; on the other hand, we examined the
interactions between the PMIs and UMIs by testing the another-load
effects instead of by measuring the recall biases, which provided a
novel perspective to understand the interaction from sharing general
VWM resources in addition to the lateral inhibition. However, when a
similar design but a change detection task was used, another study failed
to detect such interactions (Z. Li et al., 2021). We proposed that the most
likely reason could be the delayed estimation task in the current study
was more sensitive in detecting small performance changes. In addition,
another recent study noted that PMI loads affect UMI performance only
if the interval duration is too short (<1 s) to consolidate memory(Z. Li
et al., 2024). However, this view was not supported by our results and
we still observed mutual influences when memory consolidation was
completed (with a long interval of 1.5 s). Importantly, our results cannot
be adequately accounted by a pure resource-based model since larger
self-load effects were observed than another-state load effects, indi­
cating more intensive resource competition within-state than betweenstates, and could be better predicted by the state-based model.

focus of attention during their initial encoding). In this case, when the
PMI load is low or the UMI load is high, individuals may tend to store
them in the same active state to minimize the cost of state switching,
leading to greater interactions; In the latter two conditions, individuals
always encoded the first array as UMIs. Thus, as long as the load of the
first array was small, individuals would be more likely to store all items
in the same active state, resulting in stronger interactions. Regarding
different stimuli, our study revealed that the asymmetric interactions in
color and orientation recall tasks were consistent across memory loads
but became more pronounced under high loads in the location task. We
proposed two possibilities for this difference. First, it may reflect the
dissociated processing between nonspatial and spatial WM. For
example, compared with nonspatial WM, spatial WM processing could
be more automatic (Postle et al., 2000; Ungerleider & Haxby, 1994).
Second, it may just reflect the lower task difficulty in spatial WM (Cai
et al., 2018; Wheeler & Treisman, 2002). In both conditions, we would
predict only obvious asymmetrical interactions in high loads in spatial
WM. Collectively, our results suggested a highly flexible storage process
during VWM. We propose a specific account wherein items are tended to
be stored in different states under high memory loads – a strategic
adaption where the benefits of separated storage (e.g. reduced withinstate interference) outweigh the costs of state-switching (e.g. dynamic
changes of states). However, this account needs to be tested further in
future studies.
There were several limitations in this study. For example, owing to
the limited number of trials, we used recall error as an integrated index
of VWM performance. Future studies could use model fittings to further
elucidate the specific cognitive components of their interactions (e.g.,
recall precision and recall probability of targets) (Schneegans & Bays,
2016). In addition, future neuroimaging studies are needed to reveal the
neural basis of the dynamics of such asymmetrical interactions.
Furthermore, our study only focused on the condition where prioriti­
zation was identified by the recall order, future studies can further
explore whether our conclusions could extend to prioritizations identi­
fied by other manipulations such as rewards, and so on.
