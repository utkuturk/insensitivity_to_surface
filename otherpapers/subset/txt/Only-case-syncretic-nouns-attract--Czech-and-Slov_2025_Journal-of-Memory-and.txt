Introduction
Speakers sometimes make speech errors such as:
(1)

*The readiness of our conventional forces are at an all-time low.
(Bock & Miller, 1991)

In (1), the verb be takes the plural present indicative form are even
though the subject head readiness, with which it ought to agree, is
singular. The verb appears to erroneously agree with the linearly closer
noun forces, known as the attractor. Agreement errors in production
arise when the attractor mismatches the subject in number (Bock,
Eberhard, Cutting, Meyer, & Schriefers, 2001; Bock & Miller, 1991).
This has become known as the phenomenon of agreement attraction,
here exemplified in number agreement between subjects and verbs.
Number agreement, however, is not the only type of agreement
subject to attraction. Many languages have gender systems that classify
nouns, as well as other word classes (Corbett, 1979). Gender is an important and obligatory feature of agreement marking in languages such
as Czech or Slovak. See examples (2) and (3) which are translations of
the sentence A small cat was very sad to Czech and Slovak respectively.
(2)

Mal-á
kočk-a
byl-a
velmi smutn-á.
small-nom.f.sg cat-nom.f.sg was-f.sg very sad-nom.f.sg

‘A small cat was very sad.’ (Czech)
(3)

Mal-á
mačk-a
bol-a
vel’mi smutn-á.
small-nom.f.sg cat-nom.f.sg was-f.sg very sad-nom.f.sg
‘A small cat was very sad.’ (Slovak)

As can be seen, gender agreement may be manifested not only on
nouns (kočk-a / mačk-a ‘a cat’) and adjectives (mal-á ‘small’, smutn-á
‘sad’), but also on verbs (byl-a / bol-a ‘was [fem.sg.]’). Subject-verb
gender agreement is often present in Slavic languages (Corbett, 1983)
with different markings for the different genders. Take the following
contrast from Czech:
(4)

Dít-ě
byl-o
celý den venku s
kamarády.
child-nom.sg.n was-3sg.n whole day outside with friends
‘The child was outside with friends the whole day.’

(5)

Dcer-a
byl-a
celý den venku s
kamarády.
daughter-nom.sg.f was-3sg.f whole day outside with friends

‘The daughter was outside with friends the whole day.’
Gender agreement may be susceptible to attraction due to interfering attractors with gender features different from that of the subject.

Gender attraction has been shown in various production elicitation
tasks in Slovak (Badecker & Kuminiak, 2007) as well as in other languages, such as Dutch (Meyer & Bock, 1999), Spanish (Antón-Méndez,
Nicol, & Garrett, 2002), or Serbian (Milićević & Milićev, 2022). Overall,
the literature suggests that the phenomenon is present in some languages and potentially absent in others (cf. Finocchiaro & Cieślicka,
2004, for Polish).
However, agreement attraction is not confined to production. Many
studies have shown that comprehenders exhibit faster reading times
in ungrammatical sentences when attractors match the verb in the
required feature. Take the following example from the study of Wagers,
Lau, and Phillips (2009):
(6)

*The key to the cabinet unfortunately were rusty from many years
of disuse.

(7)

*The key to the cabinets unfortunately were rusty from many
years of disuse.

Slioussar (2018) proposed that attraction from syncretic word forms
arbitrates in favour of cue-based retrieval models. These models assume
that during language processing, comprehenders store the encountered
linguistic material as bundles of features, such as ‘‘NP, noun, in a
subject position, singular, feminine, nominative’’ (Engelmann, Jäger,
& Vasishth, 2019; Lewis & Vasishth, 2005; Parker, Shvartsman, &
Van Dyke, 2017; Yadav, Smith, Reich, & Vasishth, 2023). When a dependency between two constituents must be established, such as during
subject-verb agreement, comprehenders access the target constituent in
memory using retrieval cues available at the verb, such as ‘‘require an
NP, in a subject position, singular, feminine, nominative’’ if the verb is
marked for number and gender. If another noun in the sentence has at
least some features matching the retrieval cues in that it is, for example,
feminine and singular, the retrieval of the target subject noun would be
slowed down. This is referred to as inhibitory interference.
If a sentence is ungrammatical, and the subject does not fully match
the retrieval cues set by the verb, the retrieval of the subject is also
slowed down. This prediction of the model accounts for the slower
processing of ungrammatical sentences. Finally, in the agreement attraction configuration, when the sentence is ungrammatical and the
attractor noun matches some of the retrieval cues set by the verb, the
cue-based retrieval model predicts a relative speed-up, which matches
the observed agreement attraction effects (Engelmann et al., 2019). The
mechanism driving the speed-up is a race process, in which constituents
in memory compete for retrieval by means of their activation levels.
Consider example (7) again:

Wagers et al. found faster reading times in the verbal and/or postverbal region (rusty) in sentences such as (7), where the attractor
matches the verb in number, compared to (6), where it does not.
For number agreement, this effect has been widely replicated in English (e.g., Cunnings & Sturt, 2018; Jäger, Mertzen, Van Dyke, &
Vasishth, 2020; Parker & An, 2018 and Tanner, Nicol, & Brehm, 2014)
and in other languages, such as French (Franck, Colonna, & Rizzi,
2015; Franck & Wagers, 2020), Spanish (Lago, Shalom, Sigman, Lau,
& Phillips, 2015), Arabic (Tucker, Idrissi, & Almeida, 2015, 2021),
Armenian (Avetisyan, Lago, & Vasishth, 2020), German (Lago & Felser,
2018), Turkish (Lago, Gračanin-Yuksek, Şafak, Demir, Kırkıcı, & Felser,
2019; Türk & Logačev, 2024, Hindi (Bhatia & Dillon, 2022), Bulgarian (Ivanova-Sullivan, Sekerina, & Lago, 2024), and Russian (Slioussar,
2018). A meta-analysis shows that number agreement attraction effects
in the comprehension of ungrammatical sentences are reliable and
highly replicable (Jäger, Engelmann, & Vasishth, 2017).
Gender attraction in comprehension has also been documented.
Gonzalez Alonso, Cunnings, Fujita, Miller, and Rothman (2021) studied noun-adjective gender agreement attraction in Spanish. In two
eye-tracking experiments, they found evidence of gender attraction
in their ungrammatical conditions. Paspali and Marinis (2020) found
evidence for the effect in adjectival predicates and object-clitic relations in Greek, both in timed and untimed acceptability judgement
experiments. Tucker et al. (2021) reported both gender and number
agreement attraction across eight self-paced reading experiments on
Modern Standard Arabic. Interestingly, gender attraction had a larger
effect size than number attraction.
In Slavic languages, gender agreement attraction has also been attested in Russian, which is structurally close to the languages examined
in this paper, Slovak and Czech. In all three languages, there are
three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), and gender is marked
using endings both in nouns and in some verb forms, such as the past
participle. Slioussar and Malko (2016) looked at both the production
and comprehension of sentences with subject-verb gender agreement.
Attraction errors were found in the production experiment, which was
modelled on the previous study of Badecker and Kuminiak (2007) on
Slovak. Interestingly, Slioussar and Malko argued that the gender of the
head noun is crucial for the presence of agreement attraction effects,
and that the feminine gender drives the strongest, and the neuter the
weakest attraction effects. In a follow-up study, Slioussar, Magomedova, and Makarova (2022) focused on the role of case syncretism
in attraction effects in comprehension. Case syncretism refers to the
phenomenon of one word form being shared between at least two
different combinations of number, case, and/or gender (Caha, 2019).
Across two self-paced reading experiments, Slioussar et al. found that
gender attraction effects were observed only when the attractor was
case-syncretic with the nominative. Case syncretism on the subject head
served as a booster of attraction: While observed with non-syncretic
subject heads, attraction was stronger with syncretic heads.

(7)

*The key to the cabinets unfortunately were rusty from many
years of disuse.

Here, both the subject head and the attractor noun match some
of the retrieval cues set by the verb (‘‘an NP, in a subject position,
plural’’), yet neither matches them fully. In this scenario, the levels
of activation of the two nouns are similar, which has been shown to
result in faster average retrieval times, and referred to as facilitatory
interference (Logačev & Vasishth, 2016).
Empirical support for facilitatory interference is robust, while the
evidence in favour of inhibitory interference for morphosyntactic features is more mixed (Jäger et al., 2017; Laurinavichyute & von der
Malsburg, 2024; Nicenboim & Vasishth, 2018; Yadav et al., 2023).
While there are other competing explanations for attraction effects
(see Dempsey, Christianson, & Tanner, 2022; Eberhard, Cutting, &
Bock, 2005a; Hammerly, Staub, & Dillon, 2019; Smith, Franck, & Tabor,
2018, and Keshev, Cartner, Meltzer-Asscher, & Dillon, 2024), the cuebased retrieval model has enjoyed wide popularity as one of the main
explanatory accounts.
The cue-based retrieval model predicts equal attraction effects in
number and gender because it assigns all features the same weights
(Engelmann et al., 2019; Lewis & Vasishth, 2005; Yadav et al., 2023).
This model setting can be changed if empirical estimates point to the
greater importance of gender. Gender might indeed turn out to be more
prominent for parsing because, in contrast to number, it is lexical.
Consequently, gender violations might be perceived as more disruptive
and more in need of repair. Currently, the empirical evidence is rather
scarce and does not allow us to distinguish between these options.
Importantly, the mechanism driving attraction proposed by the
cue-based retrieval model relies on domain-general memory mechanisms and language-specific morphosyntactic features that participate
in agreement. As long as in any language some features are used
for agreement, the cue-based retrieval model predicts an agreement
attraction effect in this language. However, several studies suggest that
Czech speakers might be resilient to agreement attraction to a large
extent.

syncretism, we adopted the ACT-R’s partial match functionality that
allows for items in memory to receive activation from a retrieval
cue that they match only in part. For example, if the retrieval cue
is ‘‘round’’, a circle would be a full match, and an oval—a partial
match. Here, we entertained two possibilities: The word form syncretic
between the accusative and nominative could either fully or partially
match the ‘‘+nominative’’ retrieval cue. To explore a wider range of
model predictions, we also varied the number of features and retrieval
cues, and used either two (gender and case) or three (subjecthood,
gender, and case) features (using a version of the model extended for
three retrieval cues by Laurinavichyute & von der Malsburg, 2024).
In the case of two features, gender and case, a slowdown due
to ungrammaticality is predicted in the matching and mismatching
non-syncretic conditions (see Fig. 1). In the mismatching syncretic
condition, the slowdown vanishes under the full match assumption
and becomes much smaller under the partial match assumption. This
decreased penalty for ungrammaticality in mismatching conditions
corresponds to a typical agreement attraction effect in ungrammatical
sentences.
This attraction effect disappears if an additional ‘‘+ subject’’ retrieval cue is assumed (see Fig. 2). This corresponds to the intuition
that attraction effect only arises if syntactic information is for some
reason ignored. The differences between conditions largely vanish, and
the ungrammatical conditions are processed uniformly slower under
both full and partial match assumptions. Interestingly, the attraction
effect vanishes even if ‘‘+ subject’’ retrieval cue has the same weight as
other retrieval cues and is not in any way privileged (cf. Yadav, Paape,
Smith, Dillon, & Vasishth, 2022).
Another important prediction of the cue-based retrieval model is
inhibitory interference (i.e., a slow-down) in grammatical conditions
when the attractor matches many retrieval cues. Note, however, that inhibitory interference is predicted by the classic version of the cue-based
retrieval model (Lewis & Vasishth, 2005), but not by a modification
of the model proposed by Wagers et al. (2009), who suggested that
retrieval from memory only occurs in ungrammatical sentences. We
will return to this proposal in the General discussion (Section ‘‘General
discussion’’). Inhibitory interference should be the strongest for the
gender-matching attractor, weaker for the gender-mismatching syncretic attractor, and the weakest for the mismatching non-syncretic
attractor. The modelling estimates are provided in Fig. 3.
To summarise, under all configurations, the cue-based retrieval
model predicts: (1) that ungrammatical conditions should be processed
more slowly than grammatical ones, and that the slowdown should
be the strongest in the matching, smaller in the mismatching nonsyncretic, and the smallest (under some parameter values, non-existent)
in the mismatching syncretic conditions; (2) that within grammatical
conditions, matching conditions should be processed slower than both
the mismatching syncretic and non-syncretic conditions.

Attraction in Czech
Chromý, Lacina and Dotlačil (2023) conducted four self-paced reading experiments testing for number agreement attraction in several
syntactic configurations, including both retroactive and proactive interference (i.e., attractor following or preceding the subject head respectively). They found evidence against attraction in three out of
the four experiments. Only in the experiment that tested a retroactive
configuration (attractor following the subject head), such as in Example
(8) with syncretic attractors, did they find some weak evidence in
favour of a very small attraction effect. Lacina and Chromý (2022)
showed that in contrast to Russian (Slioussar, 2018), in Czech, attractors syncretic between the singular and plural, exemplified by the form
ženy (woman-gen.sg=nom.pl=acc.pl), which could be either singular
(genitive) or plural (nominative/accusative), did not induce number
attraction.

‘A file for archivers will [plural] probably include all findings.’

A follow-up study by Chromý, Brand, Laurinavichyute and Lacina
(2023) directly compared Czech and English translation equivalent sentences. While attraction was clearly present in English, with the effect
size being fully in line with the estimates from previous studies, no such
effect was detected in the Czech experiment. Lacina (2024) found no
illusions of grammaticality in an untimed acceptability judgement task.
At the same time, an illusion of grammaticality was found by Lacina
and Dotlačil (2024) in a speeded acceptability judgement experiment
with the case-syncretic stimuli used in Experiment 4 of Chromý, Lacina
et al. (2023) (see Example (8)). However, the attraction effect was a
whole magnitude smaller compared to the English data from Wagers
et al. (2009). Overall, support for number attraction in Czech is limited
and restricted to case-syncretic configurations.
Gender agreement attraction in Czech has not yet been studied. The
surprising absence of number attraction in Czech and, at the same time,
the presence of gender agreement attraction in production in the closely
related language of Slovak create tension that needs resolving.
Importantly, in previous research on Czech, attraction arose only
when case syncretism was present on the attractor noun. Echoing
the findings of Badecker and Kuminiak (2007), Slioussar (2018), and
Slioussar et al. (2022), this suggests that syncretism matters a great deal
when it comes to attraction, at least in languages with rich inflectional
morphology. We therefore expect that should any gender attraction
effects arise in the comprehension of Czech and Slovak, case syncretism
would play an important role. We further formalise this prediction
below using a computational implementation of a cue-based retrieval
model.
To aid in the comprehension of the following section, we briefly
introduce the study design. Attraction in Czech and Slovak is tested in
grammatical and ungrammatical sentences in the form ‘subject head
+ preposition + attractor + verbal auxiliary’, where the verb ought to
agree in gender with the subject head. The gender of the attractor is
manipulated, and is either matching, i.e., of the same gender as the
subject head, mismatching non-syncretic, which means that it is of a
different gender and that its form is unambiguously accusative, or finally, mismatching syncretic—different gender and syncretic (ambiguous)
between the accusative and nominative cases.

The current study
In the current study, we aim to test the predictions of the cuebased retrieval model and examine gender agreement attraction in the
comprehension of two closely related and mutually intelligible languages, Czech and Slovak (Golubović & Gooskens, 2015; Short, 2018)
using the self-paced reading procedure. Given the previous results of
Badecker and Kuminiak (2007) on Slovak production, Slioussar and
Malko’s (2016) study on Russian production and comprehension, and,
finally, the research of Chromý, Brand et al. (2023), Chromý, Lacina
et al. (2023), and Lacina and Chromý (2022) on number agreement
attraction in Czech comprehension, we manipulate case syncretism of
the attractor noun to examine whether syncretism plays a role in gender
attraction.
On the one hand, gender attraction errors have been documented in
the production of Slovak (Badecker & Kuminiak, 2007), which ought

to give us reason to expect the effect in comprehension, too. On
the other hand, some considerations cast doubt on the existence of
gender attraction in comprehension in Czech and Slovak. First, gender
attraction in production was only attested in Slovak in experiments
using a secondary task: Participants had to first memorise three letters, then produce a sentence, and after that, recall the memorised
letters (p. 71, Badecker & Kuminiak, 2007). Without the secondary
task, no attraction errors were attested in a pilot study (Kuminiak,
personal communication). It is possible that self-paced reading without

additional memory load might fail to elicit attraction in the present
experiment. One might suggest that in a language with explicit case
marking, the syntactic role of a noun is generally easy to identify, and
more pressure on working memory is needed to elicit confusion errors.
And secondly, the evidence from number agreement attraction studies
on Czech converges on the position that the effects in the language are
so small that they might be considered negligible. If gender is processed
similarly to number in Czech, either no or very small attraction effects
are expected.

Fig. 3. Predicted gender attraction (in ungrammatical sentences) and inhibitory interference (in grammatical sentences) depending on the model specification. Case syncretism is
realised either as a full or a partial match between the nominative retrieval cue and attractor’s case marking (syncretic with the nominative).

While the existing empirical evidence might be contradictory, computational modelling (see above) provides precise predictions for gender attraction effects dependent on case syncretism. Importantly, having three grammatical and three ungrammatical conditions allows us
to test more fine-grained predictions of the model rather than the
mere presence/absence of the effects and their direction. The relative
ordering of agreement effects would serve as the main test for the
model: If the estimated attraction effects match the predictions, the
cue-based retrieval model would receive strong support.

gender of the subject head. The two verb forms that we used were byl
(‘was [masc.sg.]’) for the masculine and byla (‘was [fem.sg.]’) for the
feminine.2 Given that the subject head was masculine in half the items
and feminine in the other, different verb forms were associated with
ungrammaticality: Feminine verb forms with masculine subject heads
were ungrammatical, and vice versa.
Each experimental sentence consisted of eight words, see Table 1:
(1) an inanimate masculine subject in the nominative singular case
syncretic with the accusative; (2) a preposition associated with the
accusative case; (3) an attractor noun in the accusative case (masculine,
syncretic feminine or non-syncretic feminine)3 ; (4) an adverb; (5 the
past-tense auxiliary (masculine or feminine); (6) a passive participle
(masculine or feminine, same as the auxiliary)4 ; (7) an adjective; (8)
a plural noun in the instrumental case. All items can be found in the
Supplementary Materials available on OSF at https://osf.io/h8bfw/.
Conditions (a), (b), and (c) are grammatical, while (d), (e), and
(f) are ungrammatical given the gender-mismatching verbal auxiliary.
Conditions (a) and (d) contain gender-matching attractors, (b) and (e)
mismatching non-syncretic ones, and, finally, (c) and (f) mismatching
syncretic attractors. The comprehension question accompanying each
item was the same irrespective of condition, namely Did the workers load
the cargo?. Every experimental item was followed by a comprehension
question.
In addition to the experimental items, we also constructed 72 fillers,
whose structure varied widely. Importantly, all of them presented
fully grammatical sentences in Czech and used the active voice (see

Experiment 1: Czech
Participants
Data was collected from 177 native speakers of Czech, who were
students at Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic, and received
course credit for their participation. Four participants who did not meet
the 75% threshold for accuracy on filler items were excluded from the
analysis. Another participant’s data was excluded due to the technical
issues this participant experienced. Thus, the final sample consisted of
172 participants. Their mean age was 23.7 years (SD = 5.19), 148 were
women, 23 men, and 1 person did not wish to disclose their gender.
Materials
The materials for this experiment were created together with the
materials for Experiment 2 (Slovak) to have translation equivalent
stimuli in both experiments. We used the sentence preambles from the
second experiment of Badecker and Kuminiak (2007). These preambles
were translated into Czech and further manipulated so they could be
used in the experiment (for example, in some cases the translation
equivalent word in Czech was of a different gender than in Slovak or
was not case-syncretic). In total, 36 translation equivalent preambles
were created for each experiment. These preambles were then completed to create a full sentence (again, translation equivalence was
abode).
Two variables were manipulated: (i) attractor type (i.e., its gender
and syncretism) and (ii) the grammaticality of the past tense verb form.
The sentence subject was always syncretic between the nominative and
accusative singular, and was either feminine or masculine. This gender
of the subject was manipulated between items, with half of the items
having masculine and the other half feminine subjects. The attractor
factor had three levels: Attractors either matched or mismatched the
subject in gender. Gender-mismatching attractors were either syncretic
with the nominative singular (ambiguous case marking) or not (unambiguous case marking). The grammaticality manipulation had two levels:
The gender marking of the verb either matched or mismatched the

2
In Czech, gender is marked for plural subjects too, but the distinction
between masculine and feminine subjects is only present in writing with the
same phonological realisation. Plural neuter subjects require a distinct form
of the verb that is syncretic with that of the feminine singular. However, all
of these distinctions are only present in the formal written registers of the
language, while in colloquial Czech, they have been eroded (Cvrček et al.,
2015).
3
Following data collection, we discovered an error in item no. 26 where
the attractor word in the mismatching syncretic condition was of the wrong
gender. This meant that this condition in this one item behaved the same
as the matching condition. In order to deal with this issue, we removed the
trials with this item in both the grammatical and ungrammatical mismatching
syncretic conditions in all experiments.
4
Some previous studies on Czech and English also used passive sentences
(Czech and English: Chromý, Brand et al. (2023); Czech: Chromý, Lacina
et al. (2023), Exp. 2), while other studies used actives (Czech: Chromý, Lacina
et al., 2023, Expts. 1, 2, 4), and no difference due to passive/active voice was
detected.

Procedure
We employed the moving window word-by-word self-paced reading
method administered online on the PCIbex platform (Zehr & Schwarz,
2018). Participants were given access to a link to the experimental
website. Upon clicking on it, they were first given a consent form. Next,
they filled out a brief demographic questionnaire. They were then given
three practice sentences to get used to the self-paced reading method
and the task, which was reading sentences at their own pace and
answering yes–no comprehension questions that appeared after each
trial. These questions targeted the content of the preceding sentences
and were answered by mouse clicking. We set no time limit for the
answer and gave no feedback. Individual participants saw only one of
the six conditions of each item. These were distributed using the Latinsquare design. Participants were therefore exposed to six exemplars of
each condition. The average completion time for the experiment was
about 20 min.

Data analysis
Reading times smaller than 130 ms or greater than 6000 ms were excluded from the analysis. Overall, 0.46% of data points were excluded
in this way.
To model reading times, we ran Bayesian hierarchical models with
log-normal likelihood on three regions of interest: the verb, verb+1
and verb+2 regions. We used the brms (Bürkner, 2017) package in the
programming language R (R Core Team, 2022). As fixed effects, we
included the two factors of attractor and grammaticality, and their interaction. The attractor factor was coded using Helmert contrast coding,
with the first level comparing identical (−1) and non-syncretic (1) conditions, and the second level comparing the average of identical (−1)
and non-syncretic (−1) conditions against the syncretic (2) condition.
The grammaticality factor was sum-coded, with grammatical conditions
coded as −1, and ungrammatical conditions as 1. The random effects
structure included random intercepts for participants and items, as well
as random slopes for the two fixed effects and their interaction for both
participants and items. Correlations between random effects were not
estimated.
For effect estimation, models were run with four chains, 2000
iterations per chain, where the first 1000 iterations were discarded as
warmup. We report 95% credible intervals (95%-CrI) for the effects
of interest, i.e., the intervals which contain the parameter of interest
with 95% probability. However, formal hypothesis testing requires a
likelihood ratio test comparing two alternative models (Schad, Nicenboim, Bürkner, Betancourt, & Vasishth, 2022). Hypothesis tests were
performed using Bayes factors.

Bayes factor analyses. The models were run with 20,000 iterations
per chain, with 2000 initial iterations discarded as warmup. Because
Bayes factors can be sensitive to prior specification (Schad et al., 2022),
we report the outcomes under a range of priors for the interaction
of interest: 𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙(0, 0.005), 𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙(0, 0.05), and 𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙(0, 0.1), which
correspond approximately to the effect sizes of 4 ms, 20 ms, and 40 ms.
Due to Bayes factors being unstable for the full model, the random
effects structure was simplified: The models included random intercepts
for participants and items, and by-participant random slopes for the
interaction between grammaticality and attractor type.
Results
Reading times per region across conditions can be viewed in Fig. 4.
Average comprehension question accuracy was very high: 96% (SD =
5%) for critical experimental items, and 93.5% (SD = 3.9%) for filler
items.
In reading times at the verb, there was no effect of either grammaticality or attractor type (see Table 4). Both in the verb+1 and the
verb+2 regions, ungrammatical conditions were read longer (verb+1:
𝛽̂ = 18 ms, 95%-CrI: [11, 24] ms, 𝑃 (𝛽 > 0) > 0.99; verb+2: 𝛽̂ = 24 ms,
95%-CrI: [14, 33] ms, 𝑃 (𝛽 > 0) > 0.99). There were no other main effects
or interactions (see Table 2). In particular, there was no evidence for
an interaction between grammaticality and attractor type, see Fig. 5.

Discussion

Materials
The stimuli for the Slovak Experiment 2 were created together
with the items for the Czech Experiment 1 (see Section ‘‘Materials’’ of
Experiment 1). Both the experimental and filler items were translation
equivalents of the Czech stimuli used in Experiment 1. An example
experimental item with a masculine subject is given in Table 3.

In line with most previous experiments conducted on Czech, no
gender attraction was observed. Neither non-syncretic nor syncretic
attractors caused speed-ups in the ungrammatical conditions. Bayes
factors either favoured the model without the interaction, or were
inconclusive. These outcomes do not fully align with the predictions of
the cue-based retrieval model. We will further address the theoretical
implications of this result in the General discussion (Section ‘‘General
discussion’’).

Procedure
The procedure in Experiment 2 was identical to that of Experiment
1. Importantly, the instructions and demographic questionnaire were
direct translations from the Czech experiment.

Experiment 2: Slovak
Participants

Data analysis
Reading times below 130 ms and above 6000 ms were excluded
from analysis. This loss constituted 0.28% of the reading times data.

Data was collected from 123 native speakers of Slovak, who were
part of the Charles University student participant pool and participated
for course credit. Four participants who did not meet the 75% threshold
for accuracy on filler items were excluded from analysis. The final
sample consisted of 119 participants with the mean age of 21.4 years
(SD = 2.74), 85 women and 34 men.

Results
The reading times per region across conditions can be viewed in Fig.
6. Average question response accuracy was high: 96% (SD = 4.6%) for
critical experimental items, and 93.75% (SD = 4.1%) for filler items.
At the verb, verb+1, and verb+2 regions, ungrammatical conditions
were read longer (verb: 𝛽̂ = 12 ms, 95%-CrI: [4, 21] ms, 𝑃 (𝛽 > 0) > 0.99;

Discussion
In Slovak, we again found only a slowdown due to ungrammaticality, but no evidence of gender attraction, either with non-syncretic
or syncretic attractors. While in Czech, no prior study examined gender agreement attraction, for Slovak, Badecker and Kuminiak (2007)
showed that Slovak speakers can be induced to make gender agreement
attraction errors in production. The discrepancy between the results of
Experiment 2 and findings by Badecker and Kuminiak suggests that
in Slovak, there might be a divergence between attraction effects in
production and comprehension.
It comes as no surprise that the outcomes of the Czech and Slovak
experiments mirror each other. The two languages are mutually intelligible and, overall, very similar (Golubović & Gooskens, 2015; Short,
2018, also compare Tables 1 and 3). This similarity and translationequivalence of the stimuli provide an opportunity to perform a joint
analysis on both data sets. If the attraction effect was very small, such
a pooled analysis would have higher chances of detecting the effect due
to increased power and precision.5

Another reason why we might not have seen a gender attraction
effect in either the Czech or Slovak experiment, is that the region
directly following the gender-marked auxiliary verb, i.e, the verb+1
region, was itself gender-marked. This may potentially be problematic,

Note, however, that the samples in both experiments are large enough to
detect more standard-sized number attraction effects attested in English and
other languages.

as attraction effects have often been found on the region following the
verb when this region was invariant between conditions and carried no
(number or gender) marking. Therefore, in the joint analysis, we will
focus on the verb+2 region.

Discussion
The main outcome of the joint analysis is that in syncretic ungrammatical conditions in the verb+2 region, the slowdown due to
ungrammaticality was smaller than in the other conditions. This echoes
the classic agreement attraction effect, and is in line with the predictions of the cue-based retrieval model, assuming that an attractor
syncretic between nominative and accusative partially matches the
nominative retrieval cue.
Another finding of the joint analysis is that reading in Czech was
faster than reading in Slovak by 50 ms. There are two potential explanations for this effect. Firstly, the masculine form of the participle
(the verb+1 region) is one letter shorter in Czech compared to Slovak
(naložen vs. naložený, ‘loaded’), and the length effect could have spilled
over to the following region. The second potential explanation is that
the native Slovak speakers in our sample were students residing in the
Czech Republic. It is possible that due to wide exposure to Czech, their
Slovak could have been subjected to some attrition (see Kříž & Chromý,
2022).
Overall, our finding an agreement attraction effect in the verb+2
region, which is the first region not requiring gender (or number)
agreement with the subject, suggests that gender marking in the verb+1
region may have interfered with the gender attraction effect. In addition, the estimated attraction effect is very small (≈ 6 ms), which means
that more observations are needed to detect it.
Alternatively, it could be that in Czech and Slovak, gender agreement attraction only arises late. In their study on Arabic, Tucker et al.
(2021) also found that gender attraction effects occurred later, in
verb+1 (gender attraction) compared to verb (number attraction). From
the current data we cannot rule out that in Czech and Slovak, gender
attraction is only seen in the verb+2 region regardless of what comes
immediately after the first gender-marked verb.
Given that the Bayes factor analysis did not conclusively support
the attraction effect, and that the effect occurred uncharacteristically
late, we decided to run a final experiment in Czech with an improved
item design and an increased number of participants. The goal of the
experiment is to get a more precise estimate of the gender attraction
effect and to establish whether gender attraction indeed occurs late in
the language.

Joint analysis of Experiments 1 and 2
Here, we explore whether there are any differences in (a) the
strength of the attraction effect, (b) the size of the ungrammaticality
slow-down and (c) general reading times between the two studied
languages, Czech and Slovak. To this end, we conducted a joint analysis
of the two equivalent experiments reported above. We analysed the
verb+2 region, which was the first region that did not differ in gender
marking between the conditions.
On the combined dataset, we ran a Bayesian hierarchical model
similar to the models for individual experiments. We added language
as a predictor, with Czech being coded as 1 and Slovak as −1. Thus,
the fixed effects were grammaticality, attractor type, and language, as
well as all possible interactions between these. Given that language
was a between-participant factor, we did not add by-language random
slopes for participants. Since the experimental items are translational
equivalents, we added by-item random slopes for all the main effects
and all interactions. Correlations between random slopes were not
estimated.
As expected, ungrammatical conditions were read longer: 𝛽̂ = 27 ms,
95%-CrI: [18, 36] ms, 𝑃 (𝛽 > 0) > 0.99. In addition, reading in Czech
was faster than reading in Slovak: 𝛽̂ = −53 ms, 95%-CrI: [−64, −41] ms,
𝑃 (𝛽 < 0) > 0.99. Finally, across languages, there was an interaction
between grammaticality and attractor type: 𝛽̂ = −6.3 ms, 95%-CrI:
[−12, −0.47] ms, 𝑃 (𝛽 < 0) = 0.98. Nested comparisons showed that
the slowdown due to ungrammaticality was smaller in the syncretic
condition than in two other conditions (see also Fig. 7). Syncretic:
𝛽̂ = 14.9 ms, 95%-CrI: [0.51, 29.1] ms, 𝑃 (𝛽 > 0) = 0.978; non-syncretic:
𝛽̂ = 30.2 ms, 95%-CrI: [15.7, 45.6] ms, 𝑃 (𝛽 > 0) > 0.999; matching:
𝛽̂ = 37.3 ms, 95%-CrI: [21.9, 52.6] ms, 𝑃 (𝛽 > 0) > 0.999. In grammatical
sentences, the difference between the matching and mismatching nonsyncretic conditions was estimated to be 𝛽̂ = −8.86 ms, 95%-CrI:
[−22.4, 5.6] ms, 𝑃 (𝛽 > 0) = 0.11; the difference between matching
and mismatching syncretic conditions was 𝛽̂ = −6.56 ms, 95%-CrI:
[−19.9, 7.25] ms, 𝑃 (𝛽 > 0) = 0.164.

Experiment 3: Czech replication
Participants
Data from 260 native speakers of Czech was collected. Five participants who did not meet the 75% accuracy threshold on filler items were
excluded from the analysis. The final sample comprised 255 individuals
(compare to 𝑁 = 291 for the joint analysis of Experiments 1 and 2): 206
women, 45 men, and four individuals who chose to not disclose their
gender. The mean age in the sample was 23.1 years, with 𝑆𝐷 = 6.16
years.

The interaction between grammaticality and attractor type was not
supported by the Bayes factor analysis: Under broader priors, there was
evidence against the interaction (𝐵𝐹10 = 0.0001 and 𝐵𝐹10 = 0.0008),
and under the narrow prior, the evidence was inconclusive (𝐵𝐹10 =
1.12). There were no other effects or interactions (see Table 5).

and grammaticality (see Fig. 7): 𝛽̂ = −4.9 ms, 95%-CrI: [−9, −0.77] ms,
𝑃 (𝛽 < 0) = 0.99. The interaction was supported by the Bayes factor
analysis under narrow priors, see Fig. 5. Nested comparisons showed
that ungrammatical conditions were read more slowly than their grammatical counterparts in the identical and non-syncretic, but not in the
syncretic conditions (identical: 𝛽̂ = 21.2 ms, 95%-CrI: [11.5, 31.3] ms,
𝑃 (𝛽 > 0) > 0.99); non-syncretic: 𝛽̂ = 23.7 ms, 95%-CrI: [13.6, 33.8] ms,
𝑃 (𝛽 > 0) > 0.99); syncretic: 𝛽̂ = 7.93 ms, 95%-CrI: [−2.7, 18.5] ms,
𝑃 (𝛽 > 0) > 0.928). There were no other main effects or interactions
(see Table 7). In particular, in grammatical sentences, the difference
between the matching and mismatching non-syncretic conditions was
estimated to be 𝛽̂ = 4.15 ms, 95%-CrI: [−5.08, 13.5] ms, 𝑃 (𝛽 > 0) = 0.82;
the difference between matching and mismatching syncretic conditions
was 𝛽̂ = −7.73 ms, 95%-CrI: [−17.7, 2.55] ms, 𝑃 (𝛽 > 0) = 0.067.

Materials
The items used in Experiment 1 were modified: two adverbs were
added between the verbal auxiliary and the participle, while pragmatic
felicity was maintained. This was done in order to create two regions
with no gender marking for potential spillover effects. For an example
item, we refer the reader to Table 6. The same set of fillers as in
Experiment 1 was used.
Procedure
We followed the same procedure as in the previous two experiments.
Data analysis
The same steps were taken as in the analysis of Experiments 1 and 2.
Reading times below 130 ms and above 6000 ms were trimmed, which
resulted in the exclusion of 0.45% of reading times.

Discussion

Results
The reading times per region across conditions can be viewed in
Fig. 8. Average comprehension question accuracy was very high and
comprised 96.3% (SD = 4.85%) for critical experimental items, and
93.1% (SD = 5.71%) for filler items.
In reading times at the verb, there was no effect of either grammaticality or attractor type, or any interaction (see Table 7). Both at

the verb+1 region, there was an interaction between attractor type

Adding two adverbs after the verbal auxiliary as a spillover region
proved to be effective: We found a clear, although very small, gender
attraction effect in the verb+1 region. The attraction effect was specific
to syncretic attractors only and was absent in the following region
(verb+2). These findings suggest that attraction effects in Experiment 1
(and potentially Experiment 2) were masked by the presence of another
gender marked verb following the auxiliary, and that attraction in
Czech gender agreement only arises with syncretic attractors. In addition, the results suggest the timeline of gender agreement attraction
in Czech is the same as in the other languages tested.

Attraction in Czech and Slovak from a cross-linguistic perspective
Recall that recent findings suggest that in Czech, number agreement
attraction is non-existent or tiny at best (Chromý, Brand et al., 2023;
Chromý, Lacina et al., 2023; Lacina & Chromý, 2022; Lacina & Dotlačil,
2024). The current study, on the other hand, provides evidence in
favour of gender agreement attraction in Czech and Slovak (through the
combined analysis). However, what at first seems to be a contradiction
is in fact a consistent set of findings: The largest estimated number
attraction effect in Czech comprises −12 ms,6 and the estimated gender
attraction effect in Experiment 3 is −5 ms (−6 ms in the joint analysis
of Experiments 1 and 2). These estimates are much smaller than those
reported for other languages. The meta-analysis by Jäger et al. (2017)
estimates the number attraction effect to be on average −21.9 ms, with
95% credible interval between −36.4 and −9 ms. In a similar vein,
Slioussar et al. (2022) estimated gender attraction in Russian, a Slavic
language that shares many relevant features with Czech and Slovak, to
be on average −44.76 ms. This is a difference of an order of magnitude.
Also recall that the size of the grammaticality illusion effect reported
in Lacina and Dotlačil (2024) was likewise a magnitude smaller than in
English. It thus appears that in general, attraction effects in Czech (and,
possibly, Slovak) are much smaller than in other languages, including
other Slavic languages, and appear only under the condition of case
syncretism.
Although the reasons underlying these cross-linguistic differences
remain largely unclear, the present study reinforces the role case syncretism plays in the emergence of agreement attraction effects. In
Czech and Slovak, only case-syncretic attractors lead to attraction effects. More broadly, this means that attraction only occurs if attractors
are sufficiently subject-like (see also recent evidence from Romanian
by Bleotu & Dillon, 2024). It comes as no surprise that agreement
attraction was first attested in English, a language where nouns are
largely unmarked for case and therefore do not signal their syntactic
status in this way. Moreover, most studies included in the meta-analysis
by Jäger et al. (2017) were based on English, French, and Spanish,
which are all languages without grammatical case marking on nouns.
The only language with a case system that entered the meta-analysis
was Modern Standard Arabic (Tucker et al., 2015). If case syncretism
is indeed crucial for the emergence of attraction effects, evidence from
under-researched languages with well-developed case and/or agreement systems, such as the Uralic, Baltic, and Bantu languages, is of
critical importance.

General discussion
In the current study, we set out to test for the presence of gender agreement attraction effects in the comprehension of two closely
related and mutually intelligible West Slavic languages, Czech and
Slovak, and to assess the role of case syncretism in the emergence of
attraction effects. Our second goal was to evaluate the predictions of the
cue-based retrieval model against the observed effects. We conducted
three self-paced reading experiments, comparing potential attraction
effects from case-syncretic and non-syncretic attractors. In Experiments
1 (Czech) and 2 (Slovak), only the slowdowns due to ungrammaticality
were found. In the joint analysis of the data from both experiments,
a small gender attraction effect was detected in the ungrammatical
conditions in the verb+2 region, yet only with case-syncretic attractors.
In the follow-up Experiment 3 (Czech), a gender attraction effect was
detected in the verb+1 region, again only in the conditions with casesyncretic attractors. Overall, we found evidence for gender agreement
attraction, specific to the ungrammatical conditions with case-syncretic
attractors.

Only if attractors are syncretic (Chromý, Lacina et al., 2023); for
non-syncretic attractors, the estimate is non-distinguishable from 0.

is mixed: While all ungrammatical conditions were read more slowly
than grammatical ones in the joint analysis of Experiments 1 and 2, in
Experiment 3, reading times in syncretic ungrammatical condition did
not differ from those of its grammatical counterpart. We are reluctant to
interpret this null effect as a strong argument against the repair version
of the cue-based retrieval model, and suggest that this explanation is
still possible.
To summarise, the classic version of the cue-based retrieval model
by Lewis and Vasishth (2005) cannot account for the processing times
in grammatical sentences. It remains an open question whether the
reanalysis version of the cue-based retrieval model can be reconciled
with the reading times observed in ungrammatical sentences. Next,
we briefly evaluate other alternative processing models of agreement
attraction in view of our results.

Evaluating the predictions of the cue-based retrieval account
The second goal of the present study was to evaluate the predictions
of the cue-based retrieval model. Six experimental conditions allowed
us to evaluate the fine-grained predictions of the model, such as the relative magnitudes of attraction effects from syncretic and non-syncretic
attractors, respectively. To model case syncretism, we for the first time
applied the ACT-R partial cue matching functionality within a language
processing model. The predictions of the model and the outcomes of the
experiments are summarised in Fig. 9.
Overall, while the attraction effects in ungrammatical sentences
somewhat align with the predictions of the cue-based retrieval model,
the effects observed in grammatical sentences do not.
In ungrammatical sentences, the observed differences between attraction effects in matching and mismatching conditions fall roughly
in between the predictions of model variants that assume or do not
assume a syntactic retrieval cue. Using the partial cue-feature matching
functionality to model case syncretism was not sufficient to capture
the observed effect sizes. Although no model configuration perfectly
accounts for the results, the predictions align with the direction of the
effect.
In grammatical sentences, the observed effects strongly disagree
with the model’s predictions. To remind the reader, the classic cuebased retrieval model by Lewis and Vasishth (2005) predicts inhibitory
interference, i.e., a slowdown in processing times, when the attractor
matches some of the retrieval cues. Inhibitory interference should be
stronger in the matching condition, and weaker in the mismatching conditions (a positive difference between conditions is predicted).
However, the empirical estimates are indistinguishable from 0, and if
anything, rather go in the opposite direction. Our findings reinforce the
conclusions of previous studies suggesting that the cue-based retrieval
model fails to account for the processing of grammatical attraction-like
configurations (Jäger et al., 2017; Laurinavichyute & von der Malsburg,
2024; Yadav et al., 2023).
One potential explanation for the model’s failure to capture the
processing of grammatical sentences is that cue-based retrieval is only
deployed as a part of the repair process after sentence ungrammaticality
detection, as suggested by Wagers et al. (2009) and Lago et al. (2015).
Crucially, under this account, ungrammatical conditions should always
be processed more slowly than their grammatical counterparts. The
slowdown can be smaller in the attraction conditions, but it should
still be present because ungrammaticality detection and the following
repair cannot be instantaneous. The evidence from the present study

Alternative theoretical accounts
The marking and morphing account of agreement attraction was
introduced to explain attraction errors in production (Bock & Eberhard,
1993; Eberhard, Cutting, & Bock, 2005b) and was later applied to comprehension (Hammerly et al., 2019). It assumes that the subject noun
phrase can be miscast as having a different feature due to erroneous
percolation of this feature from the distractor noun. This theoretical
explanation is especially useful for number attraction, where the default
singular feature is believed to be underspecified. Applying the same
logic to gender attraction is less straightforward. In contrast to number,
gender is lexically bound in nouns: a certain word is either masculine,
neuter, or feminine, whereas the same noun can take different number
values (singular, plural, in some languages also dual). In gender opposition, no feature is underspecified, which means that a percolating
gender feature cannot overwrite the gender of the subject head noun.
Masculine can be seen as unmarked in the sense that it can stand
generically (for example, studenti which is masculine, may refer to all
the students, not only to males). However, this holds only for specific
groups of animate nouns (e.g., role nouns) and we did not use these as
subjects.
Alternatively, the gender mismatch configuration could create confusion about where the gender feature belongs (Dempsey et al., 2022;
Konieczny, Schimke, & Hemforth, 2004). This should lead to slowdowns in grammatical and speed-ups in ungrammatical gender mismatch configurations. For grammatical sentences, the slowdown predicted by the feature misencoding account is the opposite of the speedup predicted by cue-based retrieval. Importantly, the degree of feature
12

Journal of Memory and Language 143 (2025) 104623

R. Lacina et al.

misencoding should depend on how much the attractor looks like a subject. In the syncretic condition, where the attractor has the appearance
of a noun in the nominative case, confusion with the subject can arise,
and therefore, attraction should be greater. This fits the results observed
for the ungrammatical sentences, but leaves open the question of why
the slowdown in attraction conditions is not observed in grammatical
sentences.
It is possible that gender attraction predicted by the feature misencoding account is, in fact, present in grammatical sentences, but
concealed by task effects. Hammerly et al. (2019) showed that number
attraction in grammatical sentences surfaces in ratings when participants expect to encounter ungrammatical constructions. In a similar
vein, Laurinavichyute and von der Malsburg (2024) demonstrated that
number attraction (but not inhibitory interference) in grammatical
sentences arises in reading times when participants are asked to judge
sentence grammaticality and disappears when participants are asked
to answer comprehension questions (recall that in the present experiments, comprehension questions were used). Speculatively, the
direction of the effect in grammatical sentences (see Fig. 9) is in line
with the expected attraction effect.
To summarise, the present results are broadly compatible with two
existing accounts of agreement attraction, the retrieval-at-reanalysis
and the feature misencoding plus task demands accounts. However, the
current study cannot at the moment further arbitrate between the two
accounts.

Based on these considerations, we believe that free word order
in Czech cannot account for the differences in the rates of attraction
between Czech and English. It also cannot account for the agreement
attraction effects arising only in the ungrammatical syncretic condition,
because if the first noun is occasionally miscast as an object, it must be
miscast in all conditions, and this should affect all conditions to the
same degree.

Limitations and future research
One potential limitation of our study is that it does not explore the
Czech and Slovak gender system in full—both languages distinguish not
only between the masculine and feminine gender, but also the neuter.
In addition, masculine nouns have different forms and agreement patterns depending on their animacy (Short, 2018). Future research ought
to examine different combinations of genders and animacy to determine
whether gender agreement attraction in Czech is dependent on specific
permutations of gender in the subject and the attractor. Another limitation is that our feminine-subject and masculine-subject items differed in
the syncretism of the gender-matching attractor. While in the masculine
subject configurations, this noun was always syncretic, this was not
the case in the feminine subject configurations, where the matching
attractor was not syncretic. Still, we do not believe that this property
of the design affected the results to a great degree: gender-matching
non-syncretic attractors should have made sentence ungrammaticality
more prominent, which is desired in the control condition.

Potential word order influences
Another potential explanation is that in Czech and Slovak, attraction
might only arise in situations where the comprehender experiences
uncertainty about which constituent is the subject. This might explain
why Badecker and Kuminiak (2007) report that agreement attraction
errors were found only when both the subject and the attractor were
syncretic. The key might lie in the free word order that both Czech
and Slovak have (Junghanns, 2001). Corpus research has shown that
all combinations of the basic arguments S, V, and O are acceptable
(with SVO being the most frequent), meaning that orders beginning
with O are possible and present (Siewierska & Uhlířová, 1998). If the
subject head of a sentence is syncretic between the nominative and
accusative case and is at the beginning of a sentence, comprehenders
cannot reliably disambiguate its syntactic role until later on in the
sentence. In other words, the NP might be an object as well as the
subject. Therefore, its representation as the subject might be weaker
compared to (a) cases where it is marked unambiguously with the
nominative, and (b) languages where word order fully determines the
grammatical function of each constituent (e.g., English).
However, temporal miscasting of the subject as an object should
actually increase attraction effects, not decrease them. If participants
miscast the subject, they might encode its number and gender with
lower precision because objects do not control verb agreement in
Czech. When participants later realise that the noun was, in fact, the
subject, its number and gender features might be less available, which,
in turn, should lead to more errors and increase attraction.
If the first noun is correctly cast as the subject and its features
are encoded with high precision, attraction rates should be lower.
However, in English, object-first word order is even rarer than in Czech,
which means that English speakers strongly expect the first noun to be
the subject, and yet attraction rates are much higher in English than in
Czech.
Finally, if the miscasting of the subject noun as an object does not
affect the quality of its features’ encoding, the reanalysis alone cannot
explain weaker attraction effects in Czech. According to the cue-based
retrieval model, at the reanalysis (which must occur at the verb), the
reanalysed NP must be retrieved from memory. Without reanalysis,
the subject NP must also be retrieved from memory when the verb is
processed, so these scenarios do not differ.

Finally, the hypothesis that comprehenders might not be disambiguating the initial NP as either the subject or the object when the
head noun is syncretic between the nominative and accusative should
be tested, and its role within attraction effects examined. We leave this
to future research.

Conclusion
The aim of the current study was to establish the role of case
syncretism for the emergence of agreement attraction effects, and to
evaluate the fine-grained predictions of the cue-based retrieval model
for gender attraction configurations. We ran three self-paced reading
experiments—two in Czech and one in Slovak, which are mutually
intelligible Slavic languages,—to examine gender agreement attraction
in comprehension. Our findings support the claims that attraction
arises only with case-syncretic forms. The discrepancies between the
observed effects and model predictions once again demonstrate that
while cue-based retrieval models correctly capture the processing of
ungrammatical sentences, they cannot account for the processing of
attraction-like configurations in grammatical sentences. Overall, our
study suggests that attraction effects are less universal than what the
evidence from languages with only syncretic word forms led us to
believe. This highlights the need for testing more diverse languages for
the evaluation and refinement of sentence processing theories.
