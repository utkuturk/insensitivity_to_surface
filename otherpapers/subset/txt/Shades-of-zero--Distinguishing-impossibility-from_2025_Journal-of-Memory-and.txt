Introduction
Some things are impossible. You cannot levitate a feather with your
mind, no matter how hard you try. And yet, some things are more
impossible than others. Levitating a feather with one’s mind is in some
sense easier than levitating a rock (McCoy & Ullman, 2019; Shtulman
& Morgan, 2017). Such graded judgments of impossibility are the
topic of ongoing study in cognitive science, philosophy, and cognitive
development. The idea is that people’s understanding of imaginary
worlds is rooted in their understanding of the real world (Byrne, 2007),
so studying what makes things easier or harder in the imagination
can reveal people’s understanding of everyday reality. As part of this
research, there have been different explanations for what makes some
things seem more impossible than others. The explanations are not
mutually exclusive, and include (for example) moves across ontological
hierarchies (Griffiths, 2015), causal violations (Shtulman & Morgan,
2017), perceived similarity (Goulding & Friedman, 2023), and violations of core knowledge and intuitive physics (Lewry et al., 2021;
McCoy & Ullman, 2019).

But, just as there is a dividing line between the merely improbable
and the truly impossible, there may be a category of events even
more impossible than impossible. Levitating a feather with one’s mind
is impossible in our world, but can still be imagined as occurring
in a fictional world, and fits into our intuitive theories of possible
worlds (Lewis, 1986). In contrast, events like ‘‘levitating a feather using
the number five’’ or ‘‘finding the square-root of a dog’’ cannot be
evaluated, construed, or imagined in any possible world.1 Borrowing
from philosophy, we refer to such events as inconceivable (Gendler &
Hawthorne, 2002). Our suggestion is that just as it has been fruitful for
cognitive science to study people’s understanding of the impossible, it
is useful to study people’s understanding of the inconceivable.
While the relationship between conceivability and possibility has
been the topic of much philosophical research (e.g., Balog, 1999;
Chalmers, 1996; Gendler & Hawthorne, 2002), there has been less
empirical and computational cognitive science study of inconceivability. The most closely related line of work has investigated children’s

Some readers may object that they can imagine various transformations of the example sentences to make sense of them, such as supposing ‘‘the number
five’’ refers to a particular blow-drier in a set. We refer to such transformations as coercions, and return to them in the Discussion.

distinction between events that are impossible (e.g., walking on water)
and events that are possible but highly improbable (e.g., growing a beard
down to one’s toes, or singing Jingle Bells at a birthday party) (e.g.,
Browne & Woolley, 2004; Goulding & Friedman, 2021; Goulding et al.,
2023; Komatsu & Galotti, 1986; Lane et al., 2016; Shtulman, 2009;
Shtulman & Carey, 2007). A main finding across these studies is that
while even preschool-age children can distinguish impossible and probable events, they tend to judge improbable (or expectation-violating)
events as impossible, and that the ability to distinguish the improbable
and impossible is refined with age. This has been taken by some to
suggest that young children try to conceive of an improbable event,
fail, and judge their inability to conceive of it as evidence that the event
cannot occur at all (Harris, 2021). However, such a distinction would
not explain the impossible/inconceivable divide for adults: adults are
easily able to imagine things they judge to be impossible, at least
in our world. These findings in general leave open the question of
whether adults naturally treat impossible and inconceivable as distinct modal categories (as they do for impossible and improbable), or
whether people naturally treat inconceivability as simply an instance
of impossibility.
We begin by investigating whether people can readily distinguish
the impossible from the inconceivable, using categorization studies
similar to those used to investigate the differences between improbable
and impossible. These categorization tests follow the logic of the cognitive development studies mentioned above, which conclude that young
children do not distinguish improbable from impossible events early in
development, but refine their understanding over early childhood (e.g.,
Shtulman, 2009; Shtulman & Carey, 2007; Shtulman & Phillips, 2018).
In our first experiment (Section ‘‘Experiment 1: Modal classification
task’’), we introduce a novel set of stimuli featuring event descriptions
in four different modal categories (probable, improbable, impossible,
and inconceivable), and validate them by examining whether people intuitively and reliably distinguish inconceivable event descriptions from
event descriptions belonging to the other modal categories. We find
that people are highly consistent in their categorizations, suggesting
the set of inconceivable event descriptions is easily distinguished from
the sets of impossible and improbable event descriptions.
Having established that people readily do make this distinction, we
then examine how this distinction might be made. Broadly, there are
two functional accounts for how the distinction between impossibility
and inconceivability may work, corresponding to a distinction in kind,
and a distinction of degree. A functional framework in support of the
distinction in kind would argue that encountering the inconceivable
is similar to the mind encountering a category error (Magidor, 2009;
Ryle, 1949), leading to either termination of further processing, or
the need to coerce the meaning of the original event. Category errors
may in turn be similar to ‘‘type errors’’ encountered by type-based
computer programs (Magidor, 2009; Sosa & Ullman, 2022). This general view also connects to a literature on type-theoretic distinctions in
semantic theory (e.g., Bekki, 2014; Chatzikyriakidis & Luo, 2020; Luo,
2012; Montague, 1973; Sutton, 2024), and psycholinguistic studies of
selectional restrictions (Chomsky, 1965; Katz & Fodor, 1963) in language processing (e.g., Paczynski & Kuperberg, 2012; Sitnikova et al.,
2008; Warren & McConnell, 2007; Warren et al., 2015). An alternative
possibility is that people have a single, graded notion of probability,
where all modal events exist on a spectrum, including the improbable,
impossible, and inconceivable. Each event is processed and assigned
some probability of occurring, and modal categories are then read out
by defining a straightforward transformation on top of the underlying
probabilities. As a simplified example, one could define thresholds on
probability values such that improbable events are one-in-a-hundred,
impossible are one-in-a-million, and inconceivable are one-in-a-trillion.
This view also connects to prior proposals that selectional restrictions
can be defined based on statistical associations (Resnik, 1993, 1996),
and evidence that world knowledge violations elicit similar patterns
of neural activity as selectional restriction violations (e.g., Hagoort

et al., 2004; Matsuki et al., 2011). Our experiments investigated two
potential versions of the second account (‘‘difference in degree’’), but
we do not resolve the debate of whether inconceivable differs from
impossible in kind or degree. We return to the different mechanisms for
distinguishing inconceivable and impossible in the Discussion (Section
‘‘Discussion’’).
In our second experiment (Section ‘‘Experiment 2: Subjective ratings
of event likelihood’’), we ask people for subjective ratings of the likelihood of the events from Experiment 1, on a continuous scale from
0 to 100. We find that people overwhelmingly rate impossible and
inconceivable events at the bottom of the scale, and the ratings across
these categories cannot be distinguished statistically. This suggests
that people’s modal distinctions between impossible and inconceivable
are based on information beyond simple perceptions (or transformations) of event likelihood, which weighs against a basic version of the
‘‘graded’’ view — namely, that modal categories are read off based on
thresholds upon probability.
We then investigate another version of the graded view by asking to
what extent distinctions between modal categories can be made based
on the statistical patterns of language. From a cognitive perspective,
one proposal has been that people try to imagine or simulate an event
occurring, and use the difficulty of imagination to judge the possibility
of the event (Gendler & Hawthorne, 2002; Harris, 2021; Kahneman
& Tversky, 1981). It is possible to argue that event descriptions that
we frequently encounter are easier to simulate or imagine, and event
descriptions that are very infrequently encountered will be harder
to simulate. To investigate this view, we examine whether statistical
language models (LMs) display similar behavioral signatures as humans
regarding the distinction between inconceivable event descriptions and
other modal categories. LMs are trained with the objective of predicting
sequences of tokens, which they learn to do by observing vast amounts
of text typically obtained from Internet posts, news datasets, and books.
Through this paradigm, LMs may implicitly learn the latent properties
of the world that make certain linguistic expressions more or less
likely. For example, since people communicate about events (McRae
& Matsuki, 2009) and physical observations (Louwerse, 2011, 2018), it
may be reasonable to expect that language itself contains structured information about the world. Indeed, prior work has shown that LMs may
capture important aspects of commonsense and world knowledge (see
Chang & Bergen, 2023, for review), including the distinction between
possible and impossible events (Kauf et al., 2023), and the structure
of perceptual spaces (Abdou et al., 2021; Merullo et al., 2023; Patel &
Pavlick, 2022). The autoregressive next-token-prediction objective used
to train LMs also has connections to human behaviors during language
comprehension, which involve prediction about upcoming linguistic
content (e.g., Altmann & Kamide, 1999; Kutas & Federmeier, 2011;
Levy, 2008; Shain et al., 2024; Smith & Levy, 2013) and the integration
of generalized event knowledge (e.g., Bicknell et al., 2010; Matsuki
et al., 2011; McRae & Matsuki, 2009). It is therefore argued that LMs
may learn structured information about the world (and events occurring in the world) in service of optimizing the objective of next-word
prediction.
From a machine learning perspective, the question of whether the
distinction between impossibility and inconceivability can be learned
based on statistical patterns is also highly of interest. If both impossible
and inconceivable events occur with vanishingly small frequency, it is
not obvious how LMs would learn to distinguish them in string probability space. Indeed, our work’s focus on distinctions within the region
of low probabilities – ‘‘shades of zero’’ – differs from two previous
major approaches to evaluating LMs. The first prior approach focuses
on distinguishing between broad categories which are expected to be
associated with high or low probabilities — for example, by performing
targeted comparisons between sentences that are grammatical/ungrammatical (e.g., Hu et al., 2020; Marvin & Linzen, 2018; Warstadt et al.,
2020), or describe possible/impossible events (e.g., Kauf et al., 2023).

J. Hu et al.

The second approach involves studying the behavior of LMs on naturally occurring sentences, which are expected to fall within the region
of the string distribution with most probability mass — for example,
by examining the alignment between model-derived string distributions
and human reading times on naturalistic sentences (e.g., Brothers &
Kuperberg, 2021; Hofmann et al., 2022; Shain et al., 2024; Smith &
Levy, 2013). While these approaches are reasonable and useful, we
suggest that studying distinctions within the near-zero region of the
probability distribution – such as the distinction between sentences
describing impossible and inconceivable events – can provide new
insights into the patterns and commonsense knowledge learned by LMs,
and how their representations of event likelihood relate to people’s
conceptual categories.
In our third experiment (Section ‘‘Experiment 3: Language model
evaluation’’), we test whether LMs separate the modal categories from
our stimuli through the probabilities assigned to string event descriptions, and whether these probabilities align with humans’ subjective
ratings of event likelihood (as we measured in Experiment 2). We evaluate five Transformer-based language models from the GPT-2 (Radford
et al., 2019) and Llama 3 (AI@Meta, 2024) model families, ranging
in size from 124 million to 70 billion parameters, as well as a strong
non-neural baseline (Liu et al., 2024). We find that modal categories
are strongly separated within the event description probabilities estimated by the neural models, but not within the probabilities estimated
by the non-neural baseline. Similarly, the subjective event likelihood
ratings provided by humans in Experiment 2 are predicted by the
neural models’ probabilities (but not the baseline model’s probabilities)
– although models’ probabilities vary widely across impossible and
inconceivable event descriptions, while people assign these extremely
low likelihood ratings. We additionally test how distinctions between
modal categories emerge over the course of training for a single OLMo
model (Groeneveld et al., 2024), and find that the distinction between
inconceivable and impossible emerges before the distinction between
impossible and improbable. These analyses contribute a new empirical
investigation of commonsense and event knowledge in modern LMs,
which is a central topic in artificial intelligence (Chang & Bergen,
2023; Li et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2020). In particular, we demonstrate
that LMs capture a distinction within the distribution of non-possible
events (impossible versus inconceivable), which goes beyond previous
studies focusing on distinctions either within the distribution of possible
events (likely versus unlikely) or across the boundary of possible and
impossible (e.g., Kauf et al., 2024, 2023; Wang et al., 2018).
Overall, our findings reveal high-level similarities between the way
that humans and statistical language models treat inconceivability.
First, both humans and models show an ability to categorize probable,
improbable, impossible, and inconceivable event descriptions (comparing Experiments 1 & 3). Second, the probabilities assigned to event
descriptions by neural LMs predict humans’ subjective ratings of event
likelihood (comparing Experiments 2 & 3). And third, the distinction
between improbable and impossible emerges later during LM training
than the distinctions between other pairs of categories, which is qualitatively consistent with findings in developmental psychology (e.g.,
Shtulman & Carey, 2007). However, our findings also raise questions about how humans make distinctions between impossible and
inconceivable when their subjective likelihoods are indistinguishable
(all near zero), and suggest future directions for investigating children’s perceptions of inconceivability. We return to these issues in
the Discussion (Section ‘‘Discussion’’), once we have the results in
hand.

error patterns humans make. This experiment also serves to validate
the construction of our stimuli, which we use in later experiments.
Stimuli
We manually constructed a set of 70 items designed to cover several
modal categories (see examples in Table 1). Each item consists of a
shared prefix denoting a commonplace event with a transitive verb and
object, as well as the beginning of a phrase describing how the event
occurs (e.g., ‘‘baking a cake inside’’). No explicit subject is specified.
Each item prefix is associated with five candidate continuations, each
of which completes the phrase describing how the event occurs. These
continuations reflect different types of modal relationships to the prefix.
Since the region that modulates the modal category of the event occurs
at the end of the phrase, these stimuli are well-suited to test autoregressive (i.e., left-to-right) language models, which condition on preceding
context to predict the subsequent tokens. While prior cognitive work
on modal distinctions has primarily focused on probable, improbable,
and impossible events, we additionally include inconceivable events.
We describe each condition in greater detail below.
Continuations in the Probable and Improbable conditions reflected
events that are possible given the physical laws of the real world. We
refer to these as the ‘‘possible’’ conditions. Probable continuations were
chosen to be prototypical or highly expected (e.g., ‘‘baking a cake inside
an oven’’, or ‘‘washing your hair with shampoo’’). Improbable continuations were intuitively unconventional, but did not violate any physical
constraints (e.g., ‘‘baking a cake inside an airfryer’’, or ‘‘washing your
hair with detergent ’’).
In the Impossible condition, continuations make the event impossible because of physical constraints in the real world. For example,
‘‘baking cake inside a freezer’’ violates thermodynamics. This condition
is most similar to what prior studies have called ‘‘violations of world
knowledge’’ (cf. violations of word knowledge, or selectional restrictions). But, some instances do not neatly fit into this framework. For
example, ‘‘washing your hair with a rainbow’’ could be a violation of
world knowledge, or a violation of the restrictions on the verb ‘‘to
wash’’ (i.e., [+Liquid]).
Finally, we considered Inconceivable continuations, which take
the form of an abstract concept or non-physical noun when the event
described in the prefix expects a concrete noun (e.g., ‘‘baking a cake
inside a sigh’’ or ‘‘chilling a drink using yesterday’’). This condition is
the most similar to selectional restriction violations in the linguistics
literature (Chomsky, 1965; Katz & Fodor, 1963).
Methods
We recruited 𝑁 = 149 participants on Prolific, who were based
in the United States and native speakers of English by self-report.
Participants were compensated at a rate corresponding to $12/h. Each
participant saw each of the 70 items, one item per trial. On each
trial, participants saw a prefix and a continuation in one of the four
conditions (e.g., ‘‘Baking a cake using an oven’’). Participants were
asked to categorize the stimulus into one of four categories (by pressing
keyboard buttons): probable, improbable, impossible, or nonsense. We
used the label ‘‘nonsense’’ instead of ‘‘inconceivable’’ to avoid jargon,
while capturing a similar intuition. After responding on each trial,
participants saw a screen saying ‘‘Your response has been logged’’ for
1 s. Each participant saw a nearly equal number of trials in each
condition (i.e., 17 or 18 trials for each of the 4 main conditions). The
order of trials and conditions was randomized. Prior to the experiment,
participants were familiarized with definitions and examples of each
category, and were required to correctly complete 8 practice trials
before beginning the critical trials.

Experiment 1: Modal classification task
We first developed a novel set of materials, which included short
English-language event descriptions across four modal categories: probable, improbable, impossible, or inconceivable. Our main questions
of interest are whether humans categorize events in a way that is
consistent with the underlying coding of conditions, and what kind of

Impossible as nonsense, and 16% labeled Inconceivable as impossible.
These patterns suggest that, while people do readily distinguish inconceivable from impossible (and other modal categories), the boundaries
between these categories may be graded. In the next experiment, we
more directly test this idea by investigating whether people assign
graded ratings of likelihood to impossible and inconceivable events.

Results
First, we ask whether humans categorize the events in a way that
is consistent with the researcher-defined coding of the materials. Fig.
1(a) shows the proportion of trials where people’s labels matched the
underlying condition coding. In the Probable condition, participants
agreed with our coding in nearly all cases (96%). Participants matched
our coding for the overwhelming majority of cases in the Inconceivable
condition (83%), and in the majority of cases for the Improbable (55%)
and Impossible (63%) conditions. These results suggest that people’s
judgments align with our stimulus coding at a broad level, validating
the construction of our materials. Furthermore, this provides evidence
that people can intuitively categorize inconceivable items, mirroring
and extending the findings of prior cognitive studies showing that
people distinguish the impossible from the improbable (e.g., Shtulman
& Carey, 2007).
Next, we ask what kind of choices people make, when they categorize events in a way that is inconsistent with our researcher-defined
labels. Fig. 1(b) shows the distribution of responses in each condition,
averaged across trials. The errors (i.e., trials where the participant’s
label of an event does not match our coding) are not random, but
reflect structured patterns of confusability between neighboring modal
categories. For example, when participants did not label the Improbable
items as improbable, they were most likely to label them as probable
(36%). This is reasonable, as the distinction between probable and improbable is a matter of degree, and there is inherent imprecision of the
term improbable. In addition, subjective estimates of the probabilities
of possible (i.e., probable or improbable) events may vary based on
each individual’s experiences and environments.
We also found evidence for confusability between modal categories
which, a priori, might be expected to have firm boundaries. For example, Improbable items were labeled as impossible 7% of the time, and
Impossible items were labeled as improbable 12% of the time. While
the majority of responses label Impossible items as impossible and
Inconceivable items as nonsense, we also observe some confusability
between impossibility and inconceivability. 24% of responses labeled

Experiment 2: Subjective ratings of event likelihood
In our second experiment, we asked human participants to rate
how likely events are to occur, using a slider scale. This task tests a
basic version of the view that the distinction between impossibility and
inconceivability is a difference in degree. If people’s modal distinctions
between impossible and inconceivable are based on simple thresholds
on top of subjective event likelihood, then we would expect to find
separation between the likelihood ratings assigned to impossible and
inconceivable events. If there is no separation in these ratings, then this
would suggest that people’s distinctions are made on another basis.
Methods
We used the same set of stimuli as in Experiment 1. We recruited
𝑁 = 50 US-based participants on Prolific, with a self-reported native
language of English. Participants were compensated at an hourly rate
of $12. Each participant saw each of the 70 items, one item per trial.
On each trial, participants saw a question of the form ‘‘How likely is it
for someone to [EVENT DESCRIPTION]?’’, where the event description
follows one of the four conditions (e.g., ‘‘How likely is it for someone to
bake a cake inside a sigh?’’). Their task was to respond using a slider
with endpoints marked ‘‘Extremely unlikely’’ and ‘‘Extremely likely’’,
which were internally coded as 0 and 100. No increments or numbers
were shown on the slider. Each participant saw a roughly equal number
of trials in each condition (i.e., either 17 or 18 trials for each of the 4
conditions).
We normalized participants’ responses within items, to control for
people’s perceived prior probabilities of the prefixes, independent of

the continuations. For example, ‘‘baking a cake’’ might be more likely
a priori than ‘‘docking a boat’’, and so it could be the case that someone
would rate the Probable continuation of ‘‘docking a boat’’ as less likely
than the Improbable continuation of ‘‘baking a cake’’.

Methods
Stimuli
We use the same stimuli as in Experiments 1 and 2. However, we
add an additional condition as a baseline: Inconceivable-Syntax. This
condition features a continuation that makes the full phrase ungrammatical, typically by featuring a verb, adverb, or preposition instead of
the expected noun (e.g., ‘‘chilling a drink using at ’’). We emphasize that
this condition is not the focus of our investigation of impossibility versus inconceivability — instead, it serves as a baseline, since we expect
LMs to recognize these expressions as ill-formed.2 In the context of the
current experiment, this means that we expect LMs to reliably assign
lower probabilities to these continuations, as would be consistent with
a large body of work on targeted syntactic evaluation of LMs (e.g., Hu
et al., 2020; Marvin & Linzen, 2018; Warstadt et al., 2020). Examples
of the Inconceivable-Syntax condition are shown in Table 1. Again, this
condition is only used for the model evaluation, and not the human
experiments.

Results
Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) show raw and item-normalized ratings across
conditions, respectively. We first turn to the raw ratings (on a 0–100
scale). The Probable event descriptions received near-ceiling likelihood
ratings (mean rating: 92.2), the Improbable items were near the middle
(mean rating: 45.6), and the Impossible and Inconceivable items were
near the floor of the slider scale (Impossible mean rating: 5.0; Inconceivable mean rating: 4.2). We find a similar pattern for the within-item
normalized ratings as well (Fig. 2(b)). Importantly, the Impossible and
Inconceivable event descriptions did not differ in their rating distributions (item-normalized ratings; two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test:
𝐷 = 0.04, 𝑝 = 0.37; Mann–Whitney U test: 𝑈 = 379911.5, 𝑝 = 0.79).

Models
We manipulate two properties that might affect models’ ability
to differentiate between the categories of interest: size (number of
parameters), and training time (see Table 2).
For our investigation of model size, we evaluated six open-source
language models: five neural network-based language models, and
one 𝑛-gram baseline. We include the 𝑛-gram baseline to capture a
statistical LM based purely on co-occurrence counts in a large corpus. If
this model captures human-like behaviors in distinguishing the modal
categories, this suggests that these distinctions could be explained
by different frequencies of direct experience with these events. If
not, this would suggest that the neural network-based LMs are doing
something more sophisticated than tracking frequency counts or token
co-occurrences to assign probabilities to event descriptions.
Our five neural models include three size variants of the GPT-2
family (Radford et al., 2019) and two size variants of the Llama-3
family (AI@Meta, 2024). Collectively, the models range in size from
124 million to 70 billion parameters, spanning multiple orders of
magnitude. Each neural model is an autoregressive language model
based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), and
publicly available through the Huggingface Transformers library (Wolf
et al., 2020).
As a strong non-neural baseline, we evaluate the infini-gram model
(‘‘∞-gram’’; Liu et al., 2024), which estimates arbitrarily large 𝑛-gram
counts based on the Dolma-v1.7 corpus (Soldaini et al., 2024). This corpus contains 2.6 trillion tokens created by the Llama-2 tokenizer (Touvron et al., 2023), substantially larger than other corpora commonly

To summarize our results thus far, we have found that people can
reliably distinguish impossible and inconceivable events (Experiment
1), but they assign them indistinguishable near-zero likelihood of occurring (Experiment 2). This suggests that people’s categorizations are
not based purely on differences in perceived likelihood, which rules out
a basic ‘‘threshold-probability’’ version of the view that the distinction
between impossibility and inconceivability is one of degree. However,
these results do not rule out the graded account entirely, nor do they
provide direct support for the view that this distinction is a difference
in kind (analogous, for example, to a type error). We test an alternate
version of the graded account in the next experiment, by investigating
the treatment of model categories in string probabilities estimated by
statistical language models. We return to the open question of how
people make the distinction between impossible and inconceivable in
the Discussion (Section ‘‘Discussion’’).

Experiment 3: Language model evaluation
Experiment 1 established that people can intuitively distinguish
between events in the categories of probable, improbable, impossible,
and inconceivable. Experiment 2 showed that people assign essentially
equal (near-zero) subjective likelihood ratings to sentences describing
impossible and inconceivable events. In our third experiment, we investigate whether statistical language models (LMs) treat these modal
distinctions in a similar way to humans: do the string-level probabilities
of event descriptions separate modal categories, even impossible and inconceivable? And do these probabilities align with humans’ subjective
ratings of event likelihood?

2
Whether category errors constitute a syntactic error is a long-standing
debate that we do not resolve here; see Magidor (2013).

used to estimate 𝑛-grams, such as COCA (Davies, 2008) or Google
Books (Juola, 2022).
For our investigation of training time, we evaluated 10
geometrically-spaced training checkpoints of OLMo-7B (Groeneveld
et al., 2024), ranging from 500 steps (corresponding to 2 billion training tokens) to 477,000 steps (corresponding to 2 trillion tokens). OLMo
was also trained on Dolma-v1.7, the same corpus used to estimate
𝑛-gram counts and train the ∞-gram model.

In practice, we use 𝑘 = 0.1 as a compromise between full pseudocounts
(𝑘 = 1) and no smoothing (𝑘 = 0), taking into account the large
vocabulary size of the tokenizer (under which larger 𝑘 might distort
the probability estimates more).
Finally, by comparing the surprisal of different continuations conditioned on the same prefix, there is the potential confound of observing
differences driven by frequency effects. For example, we might observe

Estimating surprisal
We use the same stimuli as in Experiment 1 (see Table 1 for
examples). To estimate how (un)expected an event is, we measure the
surprisal 𝑆 (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008), or negative log probability, of the
continuation 𝑐 conditioned on its prefix 𝑝:
𝑆(𝑐|𝑝) ∶= − log 𝑃 (𝑐|𝑝)

(2)

(1)

𝑆(an airfryer | Baking a cake using) > 𝑆(an oven | Baking a cake using),

If a model has learned to represent event probabilities in a way that
conforms to the normative coding of our stimuli, then it should assign lowest surprisal to Probable continuations, higher surprisal to
Improbable continuations, and highest surprisal to Impossible and Inconceivable continuations.
On a technical note, we are interested in probabilities assigned to
words or multi-word expressions, while models compute probabilities
at the level of tokens. To obtain the log probability of a continuation, we
take the mean log probability over all tokens within the continuation.3
This controls for the potential confound of length, as continuations that
are split into more tokens will likely have lower probabilities overall.
To deal with sparsity issues for 𝑛-gram estimates, ∞-gram performs
a version of backoff where the model conditions on the longest suffix in
the prefix that appears in the training data. Since this backoff method
still leaves open the possibility of zero counts, we also use additive
smoothing to deal with sparsity. That is, given corpus D and vocabulary

(4)
simply because ‘‘an airfryer’’ (the Improbable continuation) occurs less
frequently than ‘‘an oven’’ (the Probable continuation) in text corpora.
One way to address this would be to counterbalance the items, such
that each continuation is seen in every condition, which has been a
standard practice in other LM evaluations. However, our manipulation of inconceivability relies on pairing concrete-action prefixes with
abstract continuations, meaning that the inconceivable continuations
cannot be paired with any prefix that would make the described event
conceivable. Therefore, we instead validate our materials by comparing
the 𝑛-gram frequency counts of each continuation across conditions,
and test for whether the condition significantly affects the surprisal
values after controlling for 𝑛-gram frequencies. We estimated the 𝑛gram frequency counts of the continuations using Dolma-v1.7 (2.6
trillion tokens), the same corpus used to train the ∞-gram model.
Results

We appended a period at the end of each continuation when evaluating
the neural LMs, in order to signal the end of a sentence. This is done because
in certain cases the event description could be continued in a way that changes
the modality of the event (e.g., ‘‘washing your hair with applause’’ could be
continued with ‘‘playing on a speaker in the bathroom’’). We did not include
the final period when evaluating the ∞-gram model or estimating 𝑛-gram
frequencies in order to avoid sparsity issues.

Distinguishing modal categories
First, we compare LMs’ probability distributions to people’s categorization behaviors in Experiment 1: do LM surprisals distinguish
between the modal categories of probable, improbable, impossible, and
inconceivable?

Size manipulation. Fig. 3A shows the surprisal values for continuations in each condition, averaged across items. Numerically, for each
model, the condition-level mean surprisals are ordered in the following
way (mirroring the ordering of the x-axis): Probable < Improbable <
Impossible < Inconceivable < Inconceivable-Syntax. We additionally
analyzed pairwise comparisons of surprisals across conditions within
each item (Appendix A.1, Fig. 6), and the item-level surprisal comparisons also largely follow the condition ordering discussed above,
except for the ∞-gram model. Turning to the frequency counts of
each continuation, Fig. 3B shows the mean log count of occurrences
of each 𝑛-gram across conditions. The counts are in fact higher in
the Inconceivable and Inconceivable-Syntax conditions than the other
conditions, which should bias surprisal values to be lower in these
conditions, since LMs are sensitive to frequency effects (McCoy et al.,
2024). If we find higher surprisals in the Inconceivable conditions
relative to the others, this could not be explained purely by frequencies,
suggesting that LMs are representing meaningful distinctions across the
modal categories.
For each tested language model, we fit a linear mixed-effects regression model using the lme4 package in R to test the effect of
condition and 𝑛-gram frequency counts. We additionally included a
random intercept for each item, as specified by the following formula:
𝚖𝚎𝚊𝚗𝚂𝚞𝚛𝚙𝚛𝚒𝚜𝚊𝚕 ∼ 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚍𝚒𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗 + 𝚕𝚘𝚐𝙽𝚐𝚛𝚊𝚖𝙲𝚘𝚞𝚗𝚝 + (𝟷 | 𝚒𝚝𝚎𝚖)

violations (Inconceivable-Syntax) separate the earliest during training,
which is perhaps unsurprising. Interestingly, the separation between
Improbable/Impossible seems to occur later during training than the
separation between Impossible/Inconceivable and Probable/Improbable. The relationship between Probable, Improbable, and Impossible
seems broadly consistent with patterns of findings in the developmental
literature (Shtulman, 2009; Shtulman & Carey, 2007), where younger
children struggle to distinguish improbable and impossible events. Our
findings also suggest a novel prediction that has been largely unexplored in child psychology, and could be tested in future experiments:
the distinction between impossible and inconceivable events would
occur earlier in development than the distinction between improbable
and impossible.
Surprisal versus human ratings
Next, we compared the surprisal values derived by language models
and the human ratings measured in Experiment 2 (Section ‘‘Experiment
2: Subjective ratings of event likelihood’’). To analyze the predictive
power of model surprisals, we fit the following linear mixed-effects
regression model for each language model:
𝚛𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚗𝚐 ∼ 𝚜𝚞𝚛𝚙𝚛𝚒𝚜𝚊𝚕 + 𝚕𝚘𝚐𝙽𝚐𝚛𝚊𝚖𝙲𝚘𝚞𝚗𝚝 + (𝟷 | 𝚒𝚝𝚎𝚖) + (𝟷 | 𝚜𝚞𝚋𝚓𝚎𝚌𝚝) (6)
Overall, the model surprisals strongly predict human ratings, even
when taking frequencies into account (∞-gram: 𝑡 = −13.83, 𝑝 < 2𝑒 − 16;
GPT-2: 𝑡 = −48.193, 𝑝 < 2𝑒 − 16; GPT-2 Med: 𝑡 = −49.668, 𝑝 < 2𝑒 − 16;
GPT-2 XL: 𝑡 = −52.450, 𝑝 < 2𝑒 − 16; Llama-3 8B: 𝑡 = −58.953, 𝑝 < 2𝑒 − 16;
Llama-3 70B: 𝑡 = −57.193, 𝑝 < 2𝑒 − 16). The ordering of models in terms
of predictive power generally aligns with standard notions of model
quality: we find the weakest effect for ∞-gram, and the effect sizes
slightly increase with the parameter count of the neural models.
Fig. 5 shows the mean surprisal assigned to continuations in each
condition on the 𝑥-axis, versus humans’ subjective ratings on the 𝑦axis. While the linear relationship captures the overall trend across
conditions, it does not capture the relevant distinction between impossible and inconceivable: there appears to be substantial variation in
LM surprisal for the Impossible and Inconceivable event continuations
(yellow and red points), whereas humans rated most of these as having
near-zero likelihood. We return to this issue in the Discussion (Section
‘‘Discussion’’).

(5)

The condition variable was backward-difference coded, such that the
mean surprisal for one condition is compared to the mean surprisal
of the prior adjacent condition. In other words, the variable has four
levels, corresponding to the following four pairwise comparisons: (1)
Probable < Improbable; (2) Improbable < Impossible; (3) Impossible <
Inconceivable; and (4) Inconceivable < Inconceivable-Syntax. For each
neural model, we find a strong positive effect of each these pairwise
condition comparisons. For the baseline ∞-gram model, we find a small
but significant effect for the Inconceivable < Inconceivable-Syntax
comparison, but no effect for the other three condition comparisons.
Full results from each regression model are shown in Appendix A.2,
Table 3.
Overall, these results suggest that the modal categories from our
materials (probable, improbable, impossible, inconceivable) can be
distinguished from each other in string probability space. In addition,
the success of the neural models in contrast to the failure of the ∞gram – the strongest available 𝑛-gram-based baseline – suggests that
this ability is not simply based on word co-occurrences.

Discussion
While a great deal of recent research in cognitive science has studied
the distinctions between and within the improbable and the impossible,
far less work has empirically or computationally examined people’s
reasoning about the inconceivable. Here, we investigated inconceivable events as a distinct mental category, as a way of studying more

Training time manipulation. Next, we analyze the separability of modal
categories over training time of a single language model: OLMo-7B.

condition across training checkpoints. First, we note that the syntactic

generally how people perform modal reasoning about (im)possibility.
We found that people reliably distinguished inconceivable events from
other modal categories, including impossible ones. These results expand
on an ongoing research program in cognitive science and cognitive
development that examines people’s varying judgments of impossible
events, and their distinction from the merely improbable (e.g., Browne
& Woolley, 2004; Goulding & Friedman, 2021; Goulding et al., 2023;
Komatsu & Galotti, 1986; Lane et al., 2016; Shtulman, 2009; Shtulman
& Carey, 2007). However, using a rating task, we also found that people
did not distinguish impossible and inconceivable events through their
subjective likelihood of occurring. We also found that neural language
models – but not a strong non-neural baseline – distinguished between
impossible and inconceivable event descriptions through their string
probabilities. These probabilities broadly align with people’s subjective
ratings of event likelihood, but not within the categories of impossible
and inconceivable events.

findings are most consistent with a version of (b) where people do not
make modal distinctions simply on the basis of event likelihood, but
the statistics of language use are sufficient to separate descriptions of
impossible and inconceivable events. We next discuss View 1 and View
2 in more depth, briefly surveying previous work that suggest a priori
reasons in favor of both accounts. After establishing this background,
we then discuss potential explanations for our empirical findings.
Several lines of previous work in cognitive development (e.g., Shtulman & Carey, 2007) and philosophy (e.g., Gendler & Hawthorne, 2002;
Magidor, 2013) align with View 1 (distinction in kind). Impossible
events such as levitating a cow are nomologically impossible qua
physics, but still conceivable as occurring in some possible world. By
contrast, imagining something that is both a cow and not a cow is
a logical violation that does not even get off the ground. Computationally, one proposal for a distinction in kind between impossible
and inconceivable would be that judgments of inconceivability follow
the experience of a category error, analogous to type errors in typed
computer programs (Magidor, 2009; Sosa & Ullman, 2022). To see
this, consider the expression ‘‘square_root(45)’’. Such an expression can
be evaluated in different ways by different programs, depending on
algorithm they use, but all reasonable programs designed to handle
most math expressions will evaluate the expression. But, contrast the
previous expression with ‘‘square_root(‘dog’)’’. Such an operation will
be rejected by many programs as a type violation, as ‘dog’ is simply
not the kind of thing you can apply the square-root program to. Some
researchers have proposed that types, in the computer science sense
that enforces the expected inputs and outputs of a program, may form

As mentioned in the Introduction, previous theoretical and empirical work points to two broad functional accounts of how impossibility
and inconceivability might be distinguished: a distinction in kind, or a
distinction in degree. For simplicity, we will refer to these two accounts
as View 1 and View 2, respectively. Given these two accounts, the novel
finding that graded event probabilities (estimated by language models)
can capture people’s modal judgments could be explained in several
ways: (a) people and LMs are performing convergent computations,
either aligned with View 1 or View 2; or (b) people and LMs use
different computations but arrive at the same outcome. We note that
while our experiments do not fully tease these hypotheses apart, our

the basis of mental computation across domains and behaviors (e.g.,
Morales, 2018; Sosa & Ullman, 2022). In much the same way that a
computer program for calculating square-roots expects a number and
would throw an error when encountering a string, the mind may expect
‘‘baking a cake using’’ to be followed by a ‘physical object’ type, and
throw an error if it is followed by the wrong type (e.g. ‘‘the number
three’’). The argument would then go that inconceivable events are
naturally categorized as such by the mind encountering a type error
(‘‘imagine levitating the number 5’’ → type error → categorize as inconceivable), as opposed to impossible events, which can be evaluated
by a mental program. We note as an aside that given this view, and
to the degree that the mind contains multiple modules equivalent to
different programs, the same event or expression may be categorized
as inconceivable or not, depending on the module that is evaluating it.
This general view connects to a literature on type-theoretic distinctions and computations in semantic theory (e.g., Bekki, 2014;
Chatzikyriakidis & Luo, 2017, 2020; Luo, 2012; Montague, 1973;
Sutton, 2024). Type theory and predicate logic provide building blocks
which are fundamental to proposed compositions in natural language,
such as entities, first- and higher-order predicates, properties, and
propositions. Building on this connection, a categorical distinction
between impossibility and inconceivability has also been investigated
from a language-processing perspective. In these studies, the general
approach is to measure how people process sentences that violate
different types of knowledge. Sentences that violate ‘‘world knowledge’’
correspond to impossible events, as we can evaluate them as being
false in our world, while being able to conceive of possible worlds
or circumstances in which they are true. However, sentences that violate ‘‘word knowledge’’ (e.g., selectional restrictions; Chomsky, 1965;
Katz & Fodor, 1963) might correspond to inconceivable events, as
it is difficult to derive a literal meaning for them by combining the
lexical items.4 For example, consider the following sentences, adapted
from Warren et al. (2015):

song’’) evoke an N400 effect but no P600, whereas animacy-based SRVs
(e.g., ‘‘The pianist played his music while the bass was strummed by the
drum during the song’’) evoke both an N400 and P600. While our focus
here is on modal reasoning rather than sentence comprehension, these
studies provide behavioral and neural evidence for a distinction that
is conceptually analogous to the distinction between impossibility and
inconceivability.
In contrast to the separation in kind, View 2 suggests that the primary representation is a kind of hazy probability that never quite gets
to zero, and has no principled distinctions of kind between impossible,
improbable, and inconceivable. What we often term ‘‘impossible’’ is
simply very improbable, and what we term ‘‘inconceivable’’ is simply
very impossible. Further distinctions like ‘‘violations of causal theories’’
are then post-hoc rather than primary. If this view is true, it would
be a rather radical departure from how modal distinctions have been
proposed to operate in people. However, analogues of the graded view
have been explored in the language processing literature. Prior studies
have found that world knowledge violations elicit similar patterns of
neural activity as SRVs (Hagoort et al., 2004; Matsuki et al., 2011),
and event-based plausibility plays a rapid and important role in online
sentence comprehension (e.g., Garnsey et al., 1997; Kamide et al.,
2003; McRae et al., 1998; Van Berkum et al., 2005). Beyond this,
the lexical/world knowledge distinction might also be dis-preferred on
the basis of parsimony. Without theoretically motivated constraints, it
seems there could essentially be as many selectional restrictions (or
types, in the type-theoretic version of View 1) as there are verbs.
For example, the verb ‘‘to mail’’ can only take objects that are ‘‘mailable’’ (Myers & Blumstein, 2005), ‘‘to inflate’’ can only take objects
that are ‘‘inflate-able’’, and so on (Matsuki et al., 2011; McRae et al.,
1997). This becomes even more pronounced in our earlier example
of ‘‘levitating a feather with the number five’’: ‘‘levitating a feather’’
can only be done using the kinds of things that can be used to levitate, such as one’s mind, a magical incantation, or an instantaneous
gravity-reversing beam of energy.

(1)

Having discussed previous support for Views 1 and 2, we now
turn to how they bear on our empirical results. Broadly, we found
similarities in people’s and LMs’ behaviors: both people and LMs can
distinguish modal categories, including impossible and inconceivable.
One potential explanation is that people and LMs achieve this behavior
through similar kinds of computations. Within this explanation, one
sub-option is that they are both aligned with View 1: the primary
computation is one of causal violations, type errors, intuitive theories,
and other such distinctions of kind. The output of such computations
then appears graded, due to probabilistic thresholds on top of these
computations. The work surveyed above – bridging semantic theory,
cognitive science, and psycholinguistics – suggests that, a priori, these
kinds of computations may support modal distinctions in people. If
LM behaviors also operate this way, the internal computations and
representations learned by language models in order to arrive in their
judgments are quite sophisticated, having learned structured commonsense theories about domains such as biology and physics, and possibly
type-based reasoning. If this view is true, it would be a rather radical
departure from a common view in cognitive science that language models have not learned such representations, and it is also non-obvious
how such models could be implementing type-based reasoning, dating
back to the original debates surrounding connectionism and symbolic
representations (e.g., Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988; Pinker & Prince, 1988;
Ramsey, 1997; Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986; Smolensky, 1988).
While our findings do not definitively rule out that LMs are performing
type-based reasoning, this view makes the least contact with our data,
and would require substantial further investigation.

a. The hamster lifted the refrigerator.
b. The hamster entertained the refrigerator.
Given standard interpretations of the terms, the events in both (1-a)
and (1-b) are impossible: a hamster cannot lift a refrigerator, nor can
a hamster entertain a refrigerator. However, (1-a) is impossible because
of our physical knowledge about the world, while (1-b) constitutes a
selectional restriction violation (SRV) because refrigerators – by virtue
of being inanimate – cannot be entertained. Some theories of sentence
comprehension propose that selectional restrictions are part of lexical
knowledge, which is used more rapidly during the time-course of processing than world knowledge (e.g., Bornkessel & Schlesewsky, 2006;
van Gompel et al., 2005). For example, eye-tracking studies have shown
that SRVs appear to trigger processing difficulties that cannot entirely
be explained by the plausibility or impossibility of the event (e.g.,
Rayner et al., 2004; Warren & McConnell, 2007; Warren et al., 2015).
From the neural perspective, violations of selectional restrictions have
also been shown to elicit distinct patterns of event-related potentials,
compared to general world knowledge (e.g., Paczynski & Kuperberg,
2012; Sitnikova et al., 2008).5 For example, Paczynski and Kuperberg
(2012) find that world knowledge violations (e.g., ‘‘The pianist played
his music while the bass was strummed by the drummer during the

We emphasize the difficulty of deriving literal meanings. People can
of course derive figurative or metaphorical meanings from sentences with
apparent selectional restriction violations, and see also Magidor (2013) for
arguments that ‘‘category error’’ sentences do have meaning.
5
See Mankowitz (2023) for arguments that category errors are neither
necessary nor sufficient to trigger the N400 effect.

Another sub-option is that people and LMs both align with View
2, making distinctions between modal categories based on degree
rather than kind. The threshold-probability view appears to be the best
explanation for LM behaviors. Graded representations of probability
9

are the currency of LM computation, and it is reasonable to expect
LMs to implicitly learn generalized event knowledge as a by-product
of the next-word prediction objective (see, e.g., Kauf et al., 2023).
However, at first glance View 2 appears inconsistent with the findings
of Experiment 2, where people did not distinguish between impossible
and inconceivable event descriptions through their perceived likelihood
of occurring. We note, however, it could be the case that people judge
impossible and inconceivable events as having (near) zero chance of occurring, but they also represent graded notions of which inconceivable
events are less likely than others. For example, perhaps if we directly
asked people to rank inconceivable event descriptions in order of how
likely they are, we would find structured agreement across people, just
as prior work has found that people agree on some impossible events
being more impossible than others (McCoy & Ullman, 2019; Shtulman
& Morgan, 2017). Such a finding would suggest that people use their
commonsense knowledge to reason about events that are not only
impossible, but cannot even be imagined in a possible world (without
some process of non-literal interpretation or coercion).

between improbable and the impossible. Further, to the degree that
the later understanding rests on causal models or intuitive theories, the
earlier emergence of the distinction would support the notion that basic
modal possibility judgments may rely on other processes.
Turning now to the AI perspective, our study contributes to a line of
work seeking to understand the limitations and capabilities of language
models — in particular, what type of semantic, commonsense, or world
knowledge LMs might learn through the objective of word prediction (e.g., Chang & Bergen, 2023; Yildirim & Paul, 2024). The closest to
our work is that of Kauf et al. (2023), who found that LMs performed
poorly at distinguishing between likely and unlikely events, whereas we
found evidence that models robustly distinguished between probable
and improbable events (Section ‘‘Experiment 2: Subjective ratings of
event likelihood’’). One potential reason for this disparity is that their
likely/unlikely distinction involves social world knowledge, whereas
our probable/improbable distinction relies on physical phenomena. For
example, they tested materials such as ‘‘The nanny tutored the boy’’
(likely) versus ‘‘The boy tutored the nanny’’ (unlikely), or ‘‘The actor
won the award’’ (likely) versus ‘‘The actor won the battle’’ (unlikely).
It could be the case that the likelihood of events in these minimal
pairs can be easily manipulated through context or are more similar a
priori, where the distinctions in our stimuli are sharper and less contextdependent. For example, there may be more contexts in which actors
win battles (e.g., against their competitors in a tough audition), but
fewer contexts in which someone would chill a drink using snow. Other
studies have also shown that LMs perform poorly on ‘‘counterfactual’’
tasks which are possible but highly uncommon (conceptually similar to
our Improbable condition), such as Python with 1-based indexing (Wu
et al., 2024). These results suggest that models’ reasoning abilities are
highly sensitive to specific patterns seen during pretraining (McCoy
et al., 2024), instead of relying on more general task-solving skills.
Another related study by Sathe et al. (2024) investigated whether
LM conditional probabilities predict human acceptability judgments of
novel, unattested collocations such as ‘‘educated hairbrush’’. However,
they focused on a specific type of linguistic expression (adjective-noun
pairings) and not on modal categories. To our knowledge, our experiments test LMs on fine-grained distinctions across the widest range
of modal categories to date, and we demonstrate that LMs are able
to reliably distinguish between the likely/unlikely, unlikely/impossible, and impossible/inconceivable. These findings add to a growing
body of evidence that structured knowledge about events and physical
properties may be learned via statistical learning over linguistic forms.

In contrast, the other high-level explanation is that people and
language models are using different computations in a convergent
fashion. Within this option it is also possible that people make modal
distinctions based on graded representations, while LMs rely on distinctions of kind — but this sub-option seems the least likely, given
our findings in Experiment 2 (where people’s likelihood ratings did
not differentiate impossible and inconceivable events) as well as the
current understanding of LMs, as discussed above. The other suboption is that people make their modal distinctions in a manner of
kind, consulting ‘‘type errors’’ and causal violations, even though event
probabilities (as estimated through the statistics of language use) may
in principle be sufficient for this distinction. This option seems the most
consistent with our data. On the one hand, LMs are able to leverage
the statistics of language use to assign probabilities that distinguish
between impossible and inconceivable event descriptions. But on the
other hand, people’s likelihood judgments do not differ between impossible and inconceivable events, suggesting that people are using a
different kind of computation to form this modal distinction. However,
the caveats discussed above still hold — for example, it could be that
people would agree on the relative rankings within impossible or inconceivable events in a different task setting, and these rankings might
correspond well to LMs’ event description probabilities. We also have
not provided direct evidence for type-based computations in humans,
nor direct evidence against type-based computations in LMs. It remains
an open question how the type-error view could be cleanly separated
from the threshold-probability view in an experimental setting.

One potential limitation of our study is the validity of using LMderived string probabilities to estimate the probability of an event. As
discussed in the Introduction (Section ‘‘Introduction’’), this approach
rests on an assumption that the likelihood of using a particular linguistic expression to describe an event is a proxy for how frequently
the event occurs. This assumption faces at least two challenges, which
we discuss in more detail here. First, let us suppose that language is
used only to communicate about events that happen in the world. This
view raises the issue of reporting bias (Gordon & Van Durme, 2013;
Sorower et al., 2011): low-likelihood events may be over-represented
in language, since people are incentivized to talk about them, whereas
high-likelihood events may be underrepresented in language, since
there is little communicative benefit of talking about them. Reporting
bias is most likely to skew models’ probability estimates of probable
and improbable events, as events that do not occur in the world
(i.e., impossible and inconceivable events) will not be described in
language at all, if we adopt the view mentioned above. In our study,
we do find that LMs assign lower probabilities (higher surprisals) to
improbable than probable event descriptions, suggesting that modern
LMs can overcome reporting biases to some extent (cf. Shwartz & Choi,
2020).

In addition to comparing fully trained LMs to people’s categorization and rating behaviors, we also found interesting patterns in LM
training dynamics. Our investigation of modal categories across a single
LM’s training (summarized in Fig. 4) suggests novel predictions about
modal reasoning in children: the ability to distinguish between impossible and inconceivable should be present earlier than the ability to
distinguish between improbable and impossible. This prediction could
be tested by adapting the categorization experiments that we conducted
with adults in Experiment 1, building upon prior categorization experiments in children (Shtulman, 2009; Shtulman & Carey, 2007). We
stress that we are not claiming direct parallels between model training
and child development — these processes substantially differ in many
ways (Frank, 2023). Nevertheless, the trajectory of model training
suggests high-level interactions between exposure to linguistic data
and the emergence of key behavioral patterns (Evanson et al., 2023;
Zhang et al., 2021). In particular, the earlier emergence of a distinction
between the impossible and the inconceivable could inform ongoing
broader debates about the development of modal reasoning: It could
bridge between the emergence of basic modal reasoning and minimal
representations of possibility (Alderete & Xu, 2023; Leahy & Carey,
2020; Leahy et al., 2022) and the later understanding of the distinction

The second challenge is related to non-literal uses of language.
People use language not only to communicate about events literally

happening in the world, but also to talk about fictional or hypothetical
events, or to express figurative meanings. As a result, the probability an
LM assigns to a sentence will be influenced by the non-literal language
seen during training, in addition to factors that affect how likely the
event is to literally occur. Therefore, there may be cases where a particular string completion makes an event impossible, but is still highly
predictable given the context. For example, given ‘‘The wizard plucked
a scale from his fire-breathing’’, the completion ‘‘dragon’’ might be
extremely likely, even though dragons do not exist. This is not a major
concern for our probable, improbable, and impossible stimuli, since the
prefixes describe commonplace, physical events, which should set up
expectations for physically plausible continuations.

probabilities using language models, especially since models’ training
datasets are rife with non-literal language.
Another limitation of our study is that we focus on one particular
implementation of inconceivability: namely, the encountering of abstract concepts when a concrete noun is expected. But there is a broad
range of ways in which events might be inconceivable: for example, by
violating other features such as animacy (‘‘the refrigerator giggled’’),
or by ascribing properties to objects in other odd ways (‘‘the banana
is an hour long’’, ‘‘the theory is blue’’). It remains an open question
whether these violations share some underlying cognitive process, or
whether there are distinct avenues for dealing with different kinds
of ontological oddities. In addition, we focused on judgments across
modal categories (probable, improbable, impossible, inconceivable),
but it remains an open question how humans reason about items within
inconceivability. As discussed earlier, people make graded judgments
among things that are nominally impossible, such as levitating a feather
versus levitating a rock (e.g., McCoy & Ullman, 2019; Shtulman &
Morgan, 2017). Similarly, there may also be structured gradedness
within people’s judgments of the likelihood of inconceivable items.
Understanding the intuitive and commonsense knowledge that people
use to make judgments about inconceivability is an important direction
for future work.

Non-literal language is, however, a potential concern for our inconceivable items, which are only inconceivable when interpreted in
a strictly literal sense. For example, ‘‘washing your hair with applause’’
clearly violates physical knowledge, but could potentially be interpreted in a metaphorical manner by re-interpreting ‘‘washing’’ as a
non-physical activity. We refer to these re-interpretations of inconceivable events as coercions, mirroring the concept of type coercion
in computer science. Indeed, a prominent theory of category mistakes
argues that these types of sentences do have meaning (Magidor, 2013),
and Chomsky (1965) writes that ‘‘sentences that break selectional
rules can often be interpreted metaphorically ... or allusively in one
way or another’’. Another example of non-literal interpretation might
apply to certain impossible event descriptions, such as ‘‘baking a cake
inside a freezer’’, which could be interpreted as a phrase about cakes
that are effectively ‘‘baked’’ inside refrigerators, such as tiramisu. This
re-interpretation is potentially less metaphorical than it is about resolving communicative intent. For example, a listener might infer that a
speaker chose to use the verb ‘‘bake’’ to convey the broad concept of
preparing cakes, even though the literal definition of baking involves
ovens or dry heat. While human participants in our experiments were
told to consider the sentences in a strictly literal sense, it is not
obvious how this restriction could be enforced when measuring string

Our focus in this work was on ‘‘shades of zero’’ — distinctions
within the region of extremely low probability, beyond the typical
experience of people or models. While prior work has focused on
distinguishing between the possible and impossible (e.g., Kauf et al.,
2023), or the ability of language models to capture people’s behavior
on naturally occurring sentences (e.g., Shain et al., 2024; Smith &
Levy, 2013), we believe that investigating the distinctions between
impossibility and inconceivability is an exciting direction from both
cognitive and AI perspectives, and can illuminate the boundaries of
thought and imagination in both people and machines. In ancient
maps, uncharted territories beyond the known world were marked with
fantastical creatures that did not exist in the real world. There is much
