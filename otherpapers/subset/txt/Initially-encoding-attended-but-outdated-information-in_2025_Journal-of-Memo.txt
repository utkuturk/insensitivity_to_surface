Introduction
The capacity of visual working memory is highly limited, which can
maintain only three to four objects at a time (Luck & Vogel, 1997;
Sperling, 1960). An efficient information filtering mechanism is there­
fore essential for selecting the most relevant information from the
extensive amount of environmental stimuli, i.e. attention (Ku, 2018;
McNab & Klingberg, 2008). First, attention facilitates the filtering of
irrelevant stimuli (Awh et al., 2006; Gazzaley & Nobre, 2012). Second, it
is widely acknowledged that irrelevant information cannot be encoded
or stored in working memory (Mack & Rock, 1998; Rensink et al., 1997),
unless it has been attended to (Gao et al., 2016; Marshall & Bays, 2013;
Olson et al., 2008). Most studies supporting the selective function of
attention for working memory categorized information into two types:

task-relevant information, which has been previously attended and
needs to be recalled subsequently (deBettencourt et al., 2019; Myers
et al., 2017; Santangelo & Macaluso, 2013; Schmicker et al., 2016); and
task-irrelevant information, which does not need to be either attended
or recalled (Tanabe-Ishibashi et al., 2023; Tas et al., 2016). More
recently, another category of information has been proposed (Chen &
Wyble, 2015; Fu et al., 2021), known as attended but outdated informa­
tion, which refers to information that was previously attended to but
does not need to be recalled subsequently. Such information is quite
common in our daily life. For instance, when searching for books in a
library, we must quickly judge whether a book title belongs to the
category we need. Most titles are irrelevant, prompting us to make a
swift decision and move on without maintaining them in memory.
In a recent study, Fu and colleagues compared the memory traces of

attended but outdated information (namely the key feature) and taskirrelevant information in working memory. They found significantly
weaker working memory traces for attended but outdated information
than for irrelevant information, unless it was detected rapidly (Fu et al.,
2021). Specifically, in Experiment 4 of their study, participants first
memorized the size of the memory item unless its color was yellow (i.e.,
color served as the key feature). During the maintenance period, par­
ticipants viewed a search display containing four lines embedded within
four distinct colored shapes, and searched for a target (tilted line) among
distractor lines (vertical lines). One colored shape containing distractors
either matched the memory item’s color (match condition) or did not
(neutral condition). Results showed slower search times in the match
(vs. neutral) condition when the stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs)
between the memory display and visual search display were ≤ 600 ms;
this difference disappeared with longer SOAs. This suggested the pres­
ence of the outdated color feature in working memory, which interfered
with attention of the target. Combined with other experiments, the re­
searchers concluded that the brain actively inhibits the attended but
outdated information to block working memory entry, though the
physical salience of color may transiently allow such information into
working memory. However, their observations could not exclude an
alternative explanation, namely that the attended but outdated feature
information was first encoded into working memory but was then
removed or inhibited later. To test this hypothesis, we systematically
manipulated SOAs between the memory display and the visual search/
test display to track memory traces of attended but outdated information
at the early and the late stage of memory retention, particularly for less
salient features (such as shape).
Three experiments were conducted in the present study. Experiment
1 examined the memory trace, as indicated by the memory-driven
attentional bias, for the salient color feature as irrelevant information
(Experiment 1a) and as attended but outdated information (Experiment
1b). Importantly, Experiment 1c examined whether findings from
Experiment 1b could be generalized to the shape feature. Experiment 2
generalized the findings from Experiment 1 by adopting another wellaccepted irrelevant-distracting paradigm to probe the working mem­
ory trace. Experiment 3 employed electroencephalography (EEG) to
measure alpha modulation which is sensitive to the spatial attention of
visual information at the item location (Bacigalupo & Luck, 2019; Foster
et al., 2017) to seek neural evidence for memory traces of attended but
outdated information. Results from these experiments converged on a
common insight: attended but outdated information is initially encoded
into working memory.

automatic attentional bias towards items maintained in working mem­
ory, driven solely by active working memory representations (Olivers
et al., 2011; Soto et al., 2008). Importantly, this effect is absent during
mere passive viewing or when the encoded item is released from
working memory (Olivers et al., 2006; Olivers et al., 2011).
Methods
Participants
The sample size was determined based on the effect sizes derived
from previous comparable behavioral experiments that tested 30 par­
ticipants per experiment (Fu et al., 2021). On this basis, our analysis
revealed that a sample of 26 participants would be required to detect an
effect size (dz) of 0.58 for the working memory-driven attentional cap­
ture effect, and a sample of 20 participants would be required to detect
an effect size (dz) of 0.67 for the irrelevant-change distracting effect
with a power of 80 % at an alpha of 0.05. We set the minimum sample
size as 30 in all experiments except for Experiment 3.
Thirty young adults for Experiment 1a, thirty-five young adults for
Experiment 1b and Experiment 1c (to increase statistical power) were
recruited from South China Normal University and compensated with 30
Chinese yuan per hour for each experiment (Experiment 1a: 25 females,
Mage = 20.5 years, SD = 2.2; Experiment 1b: 31 females, Mage = 20.1
years, SD = 1.4; Experiment 1c: 33 females, Mage = 21.0 years, SD =
2.1). All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and had
no color vision defects. Informed consent was obtained from each
participant before each experiment, and the experimental procedure
was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Psychology Department at
South China Normal University (ID: SCNU-PSY-2023–332). For the
exclusion of participants, see the Supplemental Material.
Apparatus and stimuli
All experiments were programmed and conducted using MATLAB
software (The MathWorks, Natick, MA) with the Psychophysics Toolbox
extension (Brainard, 1997; Kleiner et al., 2007). The stimuli were dis­
played on a 23.8-inch LCD monitor (60 Hz, 1920 × 1080 screen reso­
lution). Participants viewed the display from a distance of
approximately 50 cm and made responses using a computer keyboard.
The background color of the screen was medium gray (RGB: 128, 128,
128). The stimuli in both the memory and search displays included
colored shapes, with colors randomly selected from red (RGB: 255, 0, 0),
yellow (RGB: 255, 255, 0), blue (RGB: 0, 0, 255), green (RGB: 0, 128, 0),
and pink (RGB: 255, 192, 203). The shapes included circles, triangles,
stars, squares, or hexagons.

Experiment 1

Experimental procedure
All experiments in Experiment 1 employed a two-factor (SOAs and
match conditions) within-subject experimental design. The independent
variables included SOAs consisting of five levels (400, 600, 1000, 1800,
and 3000 ms), and match conditions consisting of three levels (color
match, shape match, neutral). The main dependent variables were the
response times (RTs) and accuracy in the search task.
The experimental procedure of Experiment 1a is shown in Fig. 1.
Each trial started with a 500-ms fixation (1.03◦ × 1.03◦ ). After that, a
memory item (i.e., a randomly selected shape with randomly assigned
color) was presented at the center of the screen for 100 ms in either large
(2.89◦ × 2.89◦ ) or small (2.12◦ × 2.12◦ ) sizes with equal probability.
Participants were required to remember the size of the memory item so
as to perform the size change-detection task by the end of the trial. The
memory item was followed by a blank interval which was set to be 300/
500/900/1700/2900 ms with equal probability. After the blank inter­
val, there was a search display in which three distractor lines (black
vertical lines, 0.80◦ × 0.12◦ ) and one target line (black tilted line, 12◦
either to the left or to the right with equal probability) were embedded
in four distinct colored shapes (2.51◦ × 2.51◦ ) that were evenly
distributed over an invisible circle (with a radius of 7.40◦ ). There were

We adopted the definition from Fu et al. (2021) to simplify the name
of attended but outdated information: key feature, which refers to the
information that participants have to attend to and use to perform a task
but do not need to remember and report eventually. In Experiment 1, we
first replicated Experiments 4a and 4b of Fu et al. (2021) to: (i) examine
the temporal dynamics of memory traces for color as a key feature
(Experiment 1b); (ii) examine whether the disappearance of color
feature memory traces in Experiment 1b was due to forgetting by
comparing Experiment 1b with memory traces for color as an irrelevant
feature (Experiment 1a); and (iii) ensure that the methods we used were
consistent with those of Fu et al. (2021) so that any differences in the
results of other experiments with Fu et al. (2021) were due to the timing
settings rather than other methodological differences in stimuli and
procedure. More importantly, we examined the temporal dynamics of
memory traces for shape as a key feature (Experiment 1c), which is less
effective in guiding attention deployment than color features (Wolfe &
Horowitz, 2004).
Experiment 1 examined memory traces by evaluating the presence of
working memory-driven attentional bias effects for key features over
different memory maintaining intervals. This effect indicates an

Fig. 1. Task procedure of Experiments 1a, 1b and 1c. In Experiment 1a, participants were required to remember the size of the memory item and complete a changedetection task in the test. After a variable interval of blank screens during the memory retention period, a search display appeared. Participants were instructed to
search for a tilted line and indicate its direction. In the search display, one of the distractors matched the color, shape or neither feature with the memory item.
Experiment 1b followed the same procedure as Experiment 1a, with the exception that participants were first asked to determine whether the memory item was
yellow during the memory display. Participants only needed to memorize the size if the item was not yellow. Experiment 1c was identical to Experiment 1a, except
that participants were first required to judge whether the memory item was a circle during the memory display. Only if it was not a circle should they memorize its
size. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

two possible configurations for the locations of the four search stimuli
(angle relative to horizon: 30◦ /120◦ /210◦ /300◦ or 60◦ /150◦ /240◦ /
330◦ ) with equal probability. The selection of the four search stimuli was
determined by the three match conditions (color match, shape match,
neutral). Specifically, one of the three distractor stimuli could either
match the color, shape or neither feature with the memory item. In all
conditions, none of the other stimuli in the search display shared any
color or shape value with the memory item. Participants had to find the
tilted line as quickly and accurately as possible, indicating whether the
line tilted to the left or right by pressing the corresponding left or right
arrow key on the keyboard with their right hands. The visual search
display did not disappear until participants made a response. Following
the search display, a blank screen was present for 500 ms. After that,
participants had to complete the change detection task based on the
colored shape memorized at the beginning of the trial. The memorized
shape with the same color as the memory item was present again,
probing participants to judge whether its size was the same as the
initially memorized one. Participants made responses with their left
hands by pressing “J” if the size was the same or “K” if the size was
changed. There was no time limit for the change detection task. The time
interval between trials was 1500 ms. The experiment comprised 30 trials
for each match condition within each SOA, totaling 450 trials across five
experimental blocks of 90 trials each. Participants first completed 30
practice trials before the formal experiment. The entire experiment
lasted approximately 1 h. Participants were informed beforehand that
the visual search task was irrelevant to the memory task.
The procedure of Experiment 1b was the same as that in Experiment
1a, with the exception that participants were asked to judge the color of
the memory item during the memory display. If the memory item was
not yellow, participants had to memorize its size and perform the sub­
sequent size change detection task. If the memory item was yellow,
participants did not need to remember the memory item, but just report
whether the test item at the end was yellow. These trials (~20 % of the
whole trial number) served as catch trials to ensure that participants
attended to and processed the color of the memory item and were not
included in the analyses.
The procedure of Experiment 1c was also similar to that of Experi­
ment 1a, except that, in the memory display, participants were first
asked to determine whether the item was a circle. Only if the item was
not a circle were participants required to memorize its size and perform
the size change detection task in the memory test as in Experiment 1a

(shape remained the same). For 20 % of the trials, when a circle was
shown in the memory display, participants only needed to report
whether the item in the test display was also a circle.
Data analysis
To enable direct comparison of results across experiments, catch
trials in Experiments 1b and 1c, as well as comparable trials (those with
circle or yellow memory displays) in Experiment 1a, were excluded prior
to analysis. Details on data trimming are provided in the Supplemental
Material. Statistical analyses were conducted using repeated measures
ANOVAs and two-tailed t tests. In all reported ANOVAs, GreenhouseGeisser corrected p values were reported if the sphericity assumption
was violated. Additionally, Bayes factors were computed for nonsignificant results to assess the strength of evidence in favor of the
null hypothesis.
Results
Performance of the working memory task has been reported in the
supplemental material (Table S1). Preliminary analyses revealed that
the accuracy of the search task in all experiments was near ceiling (> 97
%) (see Table S1 in Supplementary Material for the averaged accuracy
(%) for each condition). Consequently, we focused on the RTs for the
search task under different conditions. Previous research has shown that
if a distractor in a visual search task shares any feature (e.g., color or
shape) with the item held in visual working memory, it automatically
attracts participants’ attention, leading to prolonged response times
(Dowd et al., 2017; Olivers et al., 2011; Soto et al., 2008). Therefore, we
mainly compared RTs of match conditions with those of the neutral
condition.
The RTs for Experiments 1a and 1b are shown in Fig. 2. For Exper­
iment 1a (color as an irrelevant feature; see Fig. 2a), a 3 × 5 two-way
repeated-measures ANOVA yielded a significant main effect of SOAs
(F2.607, 75.608 = 7.476, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.205), with decreased RTs
during longer SOAs (see Table S2). A significant main effect of match
condition was found (F1.803, 52.295 = 12.686, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.304).
Post hoc contrasts revealed that RTs in the neutral condition were
significantly faster than those in the color-match condition [mean dif­
ference (MD) = 32 ms, 95 % confidence interval (CI) [15, 48], t29 =
3.972, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.738], but not the shape-match condition

significant (F2, 68 = 3.331, p = 0.042, ηp2 = 0.089). Post hoc contrasts
revealed that RTs in the neutral condition were significantly faster than
those in the color-match condition (MD = 22 ms, 95 % CI [0, 43], t34 =
2.567; p = 0.037, Cohen’s d = 0.141), and there was no significant
difference between the neutral condition and shape-match condition
(MD = 9 ms; 95 % CI [− 12, 30]; t34 = 1.053; p = 0.888; Cohen’s d =
0.058; BF01 = 6.005). The interaction between SOA and match condition
was not significant (F4.669, 158.755 = 1.882, p = 0.105, ηp2 = 0.052, BF01

0.071, BF01 = 4.81). The interaction between SOA and match condition
was not significant (F5.853, 169.731 = 1.021, p = 0.413, ηp2 = 0.034, BF01
= 51.469). The above results replicated the findings from Experiment 4a
reported by Fu et al., (2021).
For Experiment 1b (color as a key feature; see Fig. 2a), a 3 × 5 twoway repeated-measures ANOVA yielded a significant main effect of SOA
(F2.384, 81.061 = 8.138, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.193), with RTs decreasing with
longer SOA (see Table S2). The main effect of match condition was

= 5.986). As our study primarily focused on comparing memory-driven
attentional bias between the early and the late stage of memory reten­
tion, we categorized the five different SOAs into the short (400 and 600
ms) and the long (1000, 1800, and 3000 ms) SOA conditions using the
same criterion as in Fu et al. (2021). A 2 (short SOA vs. long SOA) × 2
(neutral vs. color-match) repeated measures ANOVA showed the inter­
action was significant (F1, 34 = 4.846, p = 0.035, ηp2 = 0.125; Fig. 2b).
Simple effect analysis showed that in the short SOA condition, the search
time in the neutral condition was significantly faster than that in the
color-match condition (MD = 37 ms, 95 % CI [9, 66], t34 = 3.589, p =
0.003, Cohen’s d = 0.259), and there was no significant difference be­
tween the neutral and the color-match condition in the long SOA con­
dition (MD = 12 ms, 95 % CI [− 17, 40], t34 = 1.129, p = 0.527, Cohen’s
d = 0.193, BF01 = 3.023). These results revealed a significant memorydriven attentional bias effect for the color of a stimulus (as the key
feature) only when the SOA was ≤ 600 ms. These findings align with Fu
et al. (2021), indicating that memory traces of the key feature color were
found during the early stage of memory retention but not during the late
stage.
For Experiment 1c (shape as the key feature; see Fig. 3a), a 3 × 5 twoway repeated-measures ANOVA also yielded a significant main effect of
SOAs (F2.659, 90.399 = 13.131, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.279), with decreased
RTs during longer SOAs (see Table S2). A significant main effect of
match condition was found (F2, 68 = 5.662, p = 0.005, ηp2 = 0.143). Post

hoc contrasts revealed that RTs in the neutral condition were signifi­
cantly faster than those in the shape-match condition (MD = 25 ms, 95
% CI [7, 43], t34 = 3.365, p = 0.004, Cohen’s d = 0.135), and the dif­
ference in response time between the neutral condition and the colormatch condition did not reach significance (MD = 13 ms, 95 % CI [-6,
31], t34 = 1.703, p = 0.279, Cohen’s d = 0.068, BF01 = 3.702). The
interaction between SOA and match condition was significant (F8, 272 =
2.313, p = 0.020, ηp2 = 0.064). Subsequently, as in Experiment 1b, we
categorized the five SOAs into short (400 and 600 ms) and long SOA
(1000, 1800, and 3000 ms) conditions and conducted a 2 (short SOA vs.
long SOA) × 2 (neutral vs. shape-match) repeated measures ANOVA.
The result showed the interaction between SOA and match condition
was significant (F1, 34 = 4.275, p = 0.046, ηp2 = 0.112; Fig. 3b). Simple
effect analysis found that in the short SOA condition, RTs in the neutral
condition were significantly faster than those in the shape-match con­
dition (MD = 42 ms, 95 % CI [15, 68], t34 = 4.301, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d
= 0.230), and no significant difference was found between the neutral
condition and the shape-match condition in the long SOA condition (MD
= 14 ms, 95 % CI [− 13, 40], t34 = 1.397, p = 0.167, Cohen’s d = 0.075,
BF01 = 0.957). These results revealed a significant memory-driven
attentional bias effect for shape at the early post-stimulus stage when
it served as the key feature, indicating that this information was initially
encoded into working memory.
The results of Experiment 1c showed that the key feature, shape, was

initially encoded into working memory but subsequently ceased to
attract attention for a period of time which is consistent with the result
of Experiment 1b when color as a key feature. Overall, the results of
Experiment 1 were consistent with our expectations that the key feature
was initially encoded into working memory and subsequently removed
or inhibited.

Methods
Participants
Thirty young adults (25 females, Mage = 20.8 years, SD = 2.2) were
recruited from South China Normal University and compensated with 30
Chinese yuan per hour. For details on the sample size, informed consent,
and other information, see Experiment 1. For details on participant
exclusion, see the Supplemental Material.

Experiment 2
Experiment 2 employed another classical irrelevant-distracting
paradigm (Ecker et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2011) to test whether the ob­
servations from Experiment 1—where the matching key feature and the
search target were on different objects or locations—could be general­
ized to other working memory paradigms in which the matching key
feature was on the test target object. In this paradigm, the memory array
and test array were presented sequentially, and participants were asked
to judge whether one feature dimension (i.e., the response feature) in the
test array had changed compared to the memory array, while ignoring
other features that might also change. Previous studies have shown that
if a task-irrelevant feature is automatically selected into working
memory, its change will impair detection performance for the response
feature (Ecker et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2011). Here, we chose shape as the
key feature and color as the memory feature to avoid binding the
memory item to the key feature.

Apparatus and stimuli
The apparatus and stimuli were the same as those in Experiment 1.
Experimental procedure
Experiment 2 employed a 2 (shape congruency: change, no-change)
× 5 (SOA: 400, 600, 1000, 1500, and 2500 ms) within-subject design.
The main dependent variables were RTs and accuracy in the changedetection task.
The procedure of Experiment 2 (see Fig. 4a) was similar to that of
Experiment 1c, except for the following changes. A memory display (i.e.,
a randomly selected colored shape) was presented at the center of the
screen (2.51◦ × 2.51◦ ) for 100 ms, requiring participants to judge
whether the memory item’s shape was a circle first. Participants were
required to memorize its color if it was not a circle. The memory display
was followed by a subsequent test item that appeared after a blank

item remained the same as the memorized item, whereas in change condition, the test item had a shape different from the memorized item. (b) RTs in the change

interval, which was set to 300/500/900/1400/2400 ms with equal
probability. Participants were asked to determine whether the color of
the test item had changed compared to the memory item within 2000
ms. In half of the trials (change condition), the shape of the test item
differed from the memory item, while in the other half (no-change
condition), the shape remained the same. Participants responded by
pressing the “F” or “J” key, with the meaning of the keys (same or
change) counterbalanced across participants. The experiment consisted
of four blocks of 100 trials each, totaling 400 trials, with 40 trials for
each condition across all SOAs. The entire experiment lasted approxi­
mately 35 min.

Methods
Participants
Thirty-two neurologically healthy right-handed adults participated
in Experiment 3 (23 females; 18–25 years of age; mean ± SD age: 20.91
± 1.84 years). Ten additional participants completed the EEG experi­
ment but were excluded based on the following criteria: fewer than 50
remaining trials in any condition or more than 10 % response errors.
Informed consent was obtained from each participant before the study in
accordance with the institutional review board of South China Normal
University. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision
with no color vision defects and received payment.

Data analysis
Catch trials in Experiment 2 (the trials with a circle memory display)
were removed before any analyses. For details on data trimming, see the
Supplemental Material. The statistical analysis methods were the same
as those used in Experiment 1.

Apparatus and stimuli
The experiment was programmed and conducted using MATLAB
software (The MathWorks; Natick, MA) with the Psychophysics Toolbox
extension (Brainard, 1997; Kleiner et al., 2007). Stimuli were presented
on a 23.8-inch LCD monitor (60 Hz, 1920 × 1080 screen resolution).
Participants sat at a viewing distance of approximately 60 cm with a
chin rest, made their responses using a computer keyboard. The display
background was set to medium gray (RGB: 128, 128, 128). The stimuli
were identical to those used in Experiment 1.

Results
Since the accuracy results were near ceiling (> 97 %), we focused on
the analysis of RT. The results of Experiment 2 (shape as a key feature;
see Fig. 4b) also yielded a significant main effect of SOA (F3.193, 92.606 =
19.173, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.398), with decreased RTs during longer SOAs
(see Table S2). The main effect of shape congruency (change/no-change
conditions) was significant (F1, 29 = 5.150, p = 0.031, ηp2 = 0.151). RTs
were significantly faster in the no-change than those in the change
condition (MD = 9 ms, 95 % CI [0, 19]; t29 = 2.109, p = 0.044, Cohen’s
d = 0.385). The interaction between SOA and shape congruency was not
significant (F3.706, 107.467 = 1.800, p = 0.139, ηp2 = 0.058, BF01 = 6.366).
Similarly, we were primarily interested in the memory traces during the
early versus the late stage. As there is no a-priori criterion for binning
SOAs for the irrelevant-distracting paradigm, we therefore compared the
effects between the two conditions (change vs. no-change) at each SOA.
As shown in Fig. 4b, RT was significantly shorter in the no-change
condition in comparison to the change condition for the SOA of 400
ms (MD = 30 ms, 95 % CI [10, 49], t29 = 3.100, p = 0.020, Bonferroni
corrected for multiple comparisons, Cohen’s d = 0.566), while there was
no significant difference in any of the other SOAs (all ps > 0.15). By
adopting the irrelevant-change distracting effect to probe the working
memory trace, Experiment 2 showed a stronger memory trace of key
features in the early stage after the memory item disappeared, consistent
with the findings in Experiment 1. This mirrors the working memorydriven attentional bias effect, indicating that the memory trace of
attended but outdated information during the early stage of memory
retention is robust and can be replicated with different paradigms.

Experimental procedure
Experiment 3 employed a 2 (SOA: 400–600, 1000–1200 ms) × 3
(match conditions: color match, shape match, neutral) within-subject
design. The main dependent variables for the behavioral analysis were
the response times (RTs) and the accuracy in the search task. The main
dependent variable for the EEG analysis was alpha modulation.
The procedure of Experiment 3 (see Fig. 5a) was similar to that of
Experiment 1c. Each trial began with a 500-ms fixation display (0.80◦ ×
0.80◦ ), followed by a memory display consisting of a randomly selected
colored shape presented at the center of the screen for 100 ms (1.80◦ ×
1.80◦ ). Participants were first asked to judge whether the memory item
was a circle. They were asked to memorize its color if it was not a circle
and perform the color change detection task at the end (with size and
shape remaining unchanged). If the memory item was a circle (~20 % of
trials, serving as catch trials), participants only needed to report whether
the test item was also a circle. The memory display was followed by a
blank interval randomly jittered between 300–500 ms (short SOA) or
900–1100 ms (long SOA) in length with equal probability. After the
blank interval, a search display appeared. The display contained three
black vertical distractor lines (0.08◦ × 0.53◦ ) and one target black tilted
line (12◦ either to the left or to the right with equal probability),
embedded within four distinct colored shapes (1.80◦ × 1.80◦ ) that were
evenly distributed over an invisible circle (with a radius of 4◦ ). In each
trial, one of the distractor stimuli could match the color, shape, or
neither feature of the memory item, corresponding to the color-match,
shape-match, and neutral conditions, respectively. None of the other
stimuli in the search display shared any features (color or shape) with
the memory item. The target and matched distractor had an equal
probability (25 %) of appearing in any of the four possible locations (up,
down, left, right). Two types of stimulus arrays were presented for each
match condition, each with equal probability: lateral target with midline
matched distractor (50 %); midline target with lateral matched dis­
tractor (50 %). Participants were required to find the tilted line as
quickly and accurately as possible and indicate whether the line tilted to
the left or right by pressing the corresponding left or right arrow key
with their right hand. In the visual search task, stimuli were presented
for 1500 ms, followed by a 500-ms blank screen. Responses to the search
task were recorded both during the 1500-ms stimulus presentation and
during the subsequent 500-ms blank screen period if no response was
made during the stimulus presentation. After the 500-ms blank interval,
another colored shape appeared as the memory test item. The test item
had the same shape and size as the memory item, while its color
remained the same as the memory item in half of the trials and different

Experiment 3
Experiment 3 aimed to explore neural evidence for memory traces of
the key feature. We were specifically interested in assessing whether the
key feature would be processed or actively inhibited. To test this, we
measured EEG and examined neural indices of the key feature at
different time points. The experiment was designed to utilize spatial
(hemispheric) lateralization of alpha power, which is sensitive to the
spatial attention of visual information at the item location (Bacigalupo &
Luck, 2019; Foster et al., 2017), as an index of spatial attention triggered
by the key feature. This required presenting the distractor (key feature)
laterally while presenting the target vertically to isolate the effect of the
key feature. We continued to use the dual-task paradigm and presented
stimuli vertically and horizontally during the search task. Shape was set
as the key feature, and color was set as the feature to be remembered
(the relevant feature). To avoid a high proportion of shape-match trials
that could lead participants to perceive interference from matching
shapes, we set three match conditions identical to those in Experiment 1.

circle. If it was not a circle, they had to memorize its color and later complete a color change detection task during the test phase. During the retention interval,
participants searched for a tilted line and specified its direction. One of the distractors could match the color, shape or neither feature with the memory item. (b) The

in the other half. Participants judged whether its color was the same as
the memorized one and responded by pressing “J” if the color was the
same or “K” if the color had changed with their left hand. There was no
time limit for the change detection task. The interval between trials was
1500 ms. The experiment employed a 2 (SOAs: short versus long) × 3
(match conditions: color match, shape match, neutral) within-subject
design, with 160 trials in each match condition within each SOA. Par­
ticipants first completed 48 practice trials before the formal experiment.
There were 20 experimental blocks of 48 trials each, resulting in a total
of 960 trials. The SOA and match conditions were mixed randomly
within blocks. The whole experiment lasted approximately 2 h and
participants were informed beforehand that the visual search task was
irrelevant to the memory task.

Cap Neo Net) and the signal was recorded using Curry software (Com­
pumedics, Version 9). The EEG cap was arranged according to the
extended international 10–20 system for electrode placement. Imped­
ances of all electrodes were kept below 5 kΩ. The sampling rate was set
at 1000 Hz. EEG data were recorded in DC mode (i.e., without a highpass filter) with a 400 Hz low pass-filter. The horizontal and vertical
electrooculograms were recorded along with the EEG recordings. AFz
served as the ground electrode, whereas a built-in reference electrode
positioned between Cz and CPz served as the online reference.
The data were processed in MATLAB (The MathWorks; Natick, MA)
using EEGLAB toolbox (Delorme & Makeig, 2004) and ERPLAB (LopezCalderon & Luck, 2014) toolbox. Preprocessing involved applying a
0.1–30 Hz band-pass filter, and re-referencing data offline to the average
of two mastoids. The VEOG electrode data were excluded before rereferencing if recording failed due to equipment issues or subject
movement, as the electrode attached to the face could loosen. Then, the
EEG data were segmented relative to search task onset (from − 500 to
1100 ms) and baseline corrected by the mean voltage between − 200 to
0 ms relative to search display onset. We excluded the 20 % catch trials
in which the memory display contained a circle. Independent compo­
nent analysis (ICA) was then conducted to detect and remove compo­
nents from the data that were associated with eye movements and
blinks. Any epochs with peak-to-peak amplitudes that exceeded ± 65 μV

within a 200-ms moving window were marked for rejection with the
rejection procedure limited to a smaller time window (i.e. − 200 – 800
ms). Then, epochs that continued to show artifacts after this process
were subsequently detected and removed by eye. This, combined with
the exclusion of trials with incorrect response, resulted in an average loss
of 6.81 % of all not-circle trials (range 1.04 %–12.89 %).

Results
Behavioral results
For Experiment 3 (shape as a key feature; color as a relevant feature;
see Fig. 5b), the results also yielded a significant main effect of SOA (F1,
2
31 = 11.031, p = 0.002, ηp = 0.262), with decreased RTs for longer SOAs
(see Table S2). A significant main effect of match condition was found
(F1.726, 53.519 = 38.519, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.554). Post hoc contrasts
showed that the difference in response time between the neutral and
shape-match condition did not reach significance (MD = 0 ms, 95 % CI
[-7, 7]; t31 = -0.06, p = 0.956, Cohen’s d = -0.010, BF01 = 5.288), and
RTs in the neutral condition were significantly faster than those in the
color-match condition (MD = 31 ms, 95 % CI [21, 40]; t31 = 6.553; p <
0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.177).
The interaction effect between SOA and match condition was sig­
nificant (F1.840, 57.041 = 10.193, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.247). Follow-up
simple effects analyses revealed that in the short SOA condition, RTs
in the neutral condition were significantly faster than those in either the
shape-match condition (MD = 9 ms, 95 % CI [1, 18], t31 = 2.185, p =
0.037, Cohen’s d = 0.386) or the color-match condition (MD = 43 ms,
95 % CI [31, 55], t31 = 7.207, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.274). While in
the long SOA condition, RTs in the neutral condition were significantly
slower than those in the shape-match condition (MD = − 9 ms, 95 % CI
[-17, − 2], t31 = -2.493, p = 0.018, Cohen’s d = -0.441), but faster than
those in the color-match condition (MD = 18 ms, 95 % CI [8, 29], t31 =
3.570, p = 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.631).
These results were consistent with the findings from Experiments 1
and 2, which suggested that the key feature shape may be encoded into
working memory and attract attention during the visual search task in
the short SOA condition. Interestingly, in the long SOA condition, RTs
for the shape-match condition were faster than those for the neutral
condition, suggesting a possible attentional bias due to memory con­
tents. This contrasts with Experiment 1c, where no significant difference
emerged between the shape-match and neutral conditions in the long
SOA condition. This discrepancy might have resulted from either the
higher number of trial repetitions or the shorter SOA range (only short
and long conditions), compared to longer durations (1800 ms and 3000
ms) used in Experiment 1. Additionally, although participants had suf­
ficient time to respond, the time-constrained nature of the search task in
Experiment 3 might have introduced stress-related confounds.

Time-frequency analysis
Time-frequency analyses were conducted using FieldTrip toolbox
(Oostenveld et al., 2011). Before time–frequency decomposition, the
surface Laplacian of the EEG data was estimated (Perrin et al., 1989) to
increase the spatial resolution. Time-frequency maps were calculated
using a short-time Fourier transform of Hanning-tapered data. Spectral
power was analyzed for frequencies between 4 and 30 Hz (in 1-Hz
steps), employing a 300-ms sliding time window, advanced in steps of
10 ms. The analysis time range spanned from the onset of the search
display to 800 ms, as behavioral data indicated that participants had
essentially completed the search and judgment process by around 800
ms. The time window before the search was not included in our analysis
because it is logically impossible for there to be a difference between
contralateral and ipsilateral responses in this time window since par­
ticipants were not able to predict where the target or matching distractor
would appear on any given trial. For each subject, mean power was
extracted ipsilaterally and contralaterally relative to the lateralized item
in a given trial (i.e. the matching shape in the matching shape lateral
trials). This was expressed as a normalized difference [i.e., ((contraipsi)/(contra + ipsi)) × 100] and these contrasts were then averaged
across the left and right electrodes, following the approach of recent
studies (Boettcher et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022). Topographical maps of
lateralization were obtained using the same procedure for all symmet­
rical electrode pairs and plotted at the right electrode of each pair, as in
Boettcher et al. (2021). To extract time courses of alpha band laterali­
zation, contrasts were averaged across the predefined alpha band (8–13
Hz). Based on visual inspection of the grand average topographical map
combined with the results from cluster-based permutation tests on
time–frequency data with FieldTrip, the power of the posterior elec­
trodes in this study was the average of the following electrodes: PO7/8,
P7/8, P5/6.
EEG Statistics
Statistical evaluation of the contralateral-versus-ipsilateral contrasts
in the EEG data was performed using a cluster-corrected nonparametric
sign-permutation test (Maris & Oostenveld, 2007). This method is
particularly ideal for assessing the reliability of neural patterns across
time and frequency, as it effectively addresses the multiple comparisons
problem by evaluating clusters in the group-level data against a single
permutation distribution of the largest clusters obtained after permu­
tation of the participant-specific trial averages. Since the null hypotheses
of all tests were that no effect existed (i.e., no difference in power
lateralization), the sign of each participant’s data was randomly flipped
with a 50 % probability, and this process was repeated 1,000 times. The
resulting distribution was used to calculate the p value for the null hy­
pothesis that the mean effect was zero. All tests were two-sided, and this
procedure was applied to each time point and frequency (when appli­
cable). To correct for multiple comparisons over time and/or fre­
quencies, a cluster-based permutation test was used with 1,000
permutations, applying a cluster-forming threshold and cluster signifi­
cance threshold of p < 0.05.
Topographical sensor-level analyses were performed only to confirm
the plausibility of the results and provide a more detailed visualization
(van Ede & Maris, 2016). These analyses were not subjected to further
statistical testing.

EEG results
Lateralized enhancement of the alpha-band for the matching shape under
short SOA condition. We tested whether the key feature shape would
initially enter working memory and then be actively inhibited. To this
end, we separated short and long SOA trials and looked for neural sig­
natures of spatial attention during the search display periods. Specif­
ically, our focus was on lateralized modulations in the alpha band which
are sensitive to the spatial attention of visual information at the item
location (Foster et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2023) and reflect ongoing
attentional stimulus processing (Bacigalupo & Luck, 2019; Diepen et al.,
2016). We employed a normalized alpha lateralized index [i.e., ((contraipsi)/(contra + ipsi)) × 100], where negative values (decreased
contralateral alpha power) reflect enhanced processing of lateralized
information, while positive values (increased contralateral alpha power)
indicate suppression of lateralized information.
Fig. 6a and 6b show the time- and frequency-resolved neural mod­
ulations relative to the location of the distractor that matched the shape
of the memory item in posterior (visual) electrode clusters (PO7/8, P7/
8, P5/6). Under the short SOA condition, a significant early contralateral
enhancement effect of alpha power for the shape-match item was
observed during visual search (Fig. 6a, cluster p = 0.002). In contrast,
there was no evidence for alpha power lateralization under the long SOA
condition (Fig. 6b; cluster ps ≥ 0.2617).

(contra) versus ipsilateral (ipsi) contrast values were projected into the right sensor of each symmetrical electrode, to match the corresponding time–frequency
contrasts. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

To extract time courses of lateralization in the alpha band, we
averaged the contrasts across the predefined alpha band between 8 and
13 Hz. A cluster-based permutation test over time revealed that later­
alization differences were significantly different from zero during this
interval for the short SOA condition (Fig. 6c, cluster p = 0.008, 100 to
270 ms relative to search task display onset), while the other clusterbased permutation test for the long SOA condition resulted in no sig­
nificant clusters (Fig. 6c, cluster ps ≥ 0.1459) throughout the entire time
window. Topographical analyses confirmed that the observed laterali­
zation in the alpha band was localized in those posterior (visual) EEG
electrodes related to vision (Fig. 6d). This lateralization result in the
alpha band is consistent with time- and frequency-resolved neural
modulations, both of which suggested that there was attentional sup­
pression for the matching shape under the short SOA condition, and that

this attentional suppression appeared very early, beginning 100 ms after
stimulus onset.
Since the shape and color of stimuli at each position were random­
ized and balanced across trials, the only difference lay in whether they
matched the shape or color of the memory item. Therefore, the observed
alpha enhancement effect can be attributed to the matching shape. This
indicates that within the short SOA time window, the shape of the
memory item is actively maintained in working memory. Surprisingly,
despite significantly faster response times in the shape-match condition
compared to the neutral condition, no alpha modulation emerged under
the long SOA condition. This may be attributable to the early-stage
suppression effect, which renders further attentional processing unnec­
essary at later stages.

Alpha modulation for the matching shape in the right hemisphere predicting
the behavioral performance. To test a more direct relation between the
alpha modulation for the matching shape and the attentional suppres­
sion of the matching shape, we correlated alpha modulation with
behavioral memory-driven attentional bias effect in the short SOA
condition. The memory-driven attentional bias index was calculated by
subtracting RTs in neutral trials (where targets were presented on the
midline) from RTs in shape-match trials (where matching shapes were
presented laterally), because the alpha modulation analysis specifically
targeted these lateral shape-match trials. The alpha lateralization index
was computed by averaging spectral power within the 10–13 Hz fre­
quency range during the 180–210 ms time window, corresponding to
the peak period of alpha lateralization (see Fig. 6a, and cluster alpha is
reduced to 0.01 to find the strongest). We did not find a significant
correlation between the alpha lateralization index and behavioral per­
formance (Fig. 7a; Pearson r = -0.233, p = 0.200). However, some
studies showed that spatial visual attention is mainly dominated by the
right hemisphere (Corballis, 2003; DiNuzzo et al., 2022). Therefore, we
used electrode clusters in the left and right hemispheres to separately
correlate with behavioral performance. We observed a significant
negative correlation between the alpha modulation in the right elec­
trodes and the behavioral performance (Fig. 7b; Pearson r = -0.384, p =
0.030), indicating that greater alpha lateralization enhancement was
associated with smaller memory-driven attentional bias under the short
SOA condition. No significant correlation was found for the left elec­
trodes (Fig. 7c; Pearson r = 0.136, p = 0.458). This result indicated that
the alpha modulation in the right hemisphere, rather than the left
hemisphere, mainly predicted subsequent memory-driven attentional
bias, which revealed a direct relation between alpha modulation and the
attentional bias induced by the matching shape. Furthermore, it implied
that the lateralized enhancement in the alpha band that we observed
was indicative of attentional inhibition.

differences also significantly differed from zero for the target location in
the neutral condition (Fig. 8a, cluster p = 0.006, 420 to 600 ms relative
to search task display onset), in the shape-match condition (Fig. 8a,
cluster p = 0.008, 420 to 580 ms relative to search task display onset)
and in the color-match condition (Fig. 8a, cluster p = 0.006, 490 to 640
ms relative to search task display onset). And topographical analyses
confirmed that the observed lateralization in the alpha band was
localized in those posterior (visual) EEG electrodes (Fig. 8b).
These time courses were consistent with the behavioral results, as the
significant clusters’ onset times aligned with the response times. In the
short SOA condition, the cluster’ onset time for the target in the shapematch condition occurred later than in the neutral condition but earlier
than in the color-match condition. In the long SOA condition, both the
shape-match condition and the neutral condition’s clusters’ onset times
for the target were earlier than the color-match condition’s cluster’
onset time. This consistency might indicate that the lateralized sup­
pression of alpha-band activity reflects the state of attentional process­
ing of the object rather than merely being attracted to it as such
processing occurs relatively late, becoming evident only after 350 ms
following stimulus onset. Overall, the time course of alpha lateralization
to the target was consistent with the behavioral results and might reflect
attentional processing.
Discussion
Since attended but outdated information has been attended to but
does not need to be remembered, it seems to have a tendency to enter
working memory due to the attention it has received. How does the
brain process this type of information? We conducted a series of ex­
periments to explore the memory trace of this type of information at
different time points and found that the attended but outdated infor­
mation was initially encoded into working memory when the stimulus
was presented for a short time. Specifically, the results showed that the
memory trace of attended but outdated information in the early stage (i)
was detectable for both physically salient color features (Experiment 1b)
and relatively less salient shape features (Experiment 1c, 2 and 3); (ii)
could be captured across different working memory paradigms (e.g.,
irrelevant-distracting paradigm; Experiment 2); and (iii) would reflect
attentional inhibition toward matching stimuli, which was supported by
neural evidence showing that alpha modulation in the right hemisphere
could predict behavioral performance (Experiment 3). No significant
memory traces of attended but outdated information were detected in
the late stage (all experiments), likely resulting from attentional
inhibition.
While our findings are consistent with those of Fu et al. (2021) that

Alpha lateralization for the target. We also analyzed target-related alpha
lateralization to further examine the role of alpha lateralization in the
visual search task and the robustness of this metric. As illustrated in
Fig. 8, significant clusters of lateralization relative to the target location
were found across all three match conditions in both the short and long
SOA conditions. In the short SOA condition, lateralization differences
significantly differed from zero for the target location in the neutral
condition (Fig. 8a, cluster p = 0.002, 350 to 630 ms relative to search
task display onset), in the shape-match condition (Fig. 8a, cluster p =
0.038, 450 to 580 ms relative to search task display onset) and in the
color-match condition (Fig. 8a, cluster p = 0.004, 490 to 680 ms relative
to search task display onset). In the long SOA condition, lateralization

the attended but outdated information was indeed suppressed or
removed at a later stage after stimulus presentation, we identified robust
memory traces at the early post-stimulus stage. Why is this type of in­
formation encoded into working memory, even though it does not need
to be remembered? There are two possible explanations. One possibility
is that these attended but outdated information is automatically encoded
into working memory. First, the irrelevant information may be encoded
into working memory when attended to (Marshall & Bays, 2013; Olson
et al., 2008). Second, many studies have found that visual working
memory extracts perceptual information from a scene through an un­
economical object-based encoding process, regardless of whether the
information is relevant or irrelevant (Ecker et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2016;
Pang et al., 2023). While some studies suggest that the attention selec­
tion mode during the maintenance stage is feature-based (Niklaus et al.,
2017; Pang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2017), a reselection mechanism is
also involved (Fu et al., 2023). Based on these different memory stages
(encoding and maintenance), this attended but outdated information
might be automatically encoded into working memory as part of the
target/attended object and then actively inhibited or removed during
the maintenance stage as it is no longer needed. A second possibility is
that our brain actively encodes this information into working memory
and then inhibits it to prevent interference with subsequent activities.
There might be a protective mechanism whereby, upon encountering
the same information again, the brain inhibits refocusing attention on it
for a short period (as suggested by the neural evidence from Experiment
3). This mechanism could prevent us from reprocessing or re-evaluating
the information when it reappears in our everyday environment.
Another key finding was that alpha lateralization only in the right
hemisphere was predictive of the memory-driven attentional bias in
behavior. Enhanced alpha lateralization in the right hemisphere corre­
lated with reduced memory-driven attentional bias under the short SOA

condition. This hemispheric specificity may reflect functional differ­
ences between hemispheres during directed attention. Within spatial
attention domains, extensive evidence demonstrated the right hemi­
sphere’s dominance for directing attention across the entire visual field,
while the left hemisphere primarily manages right hemifield attention
(Mesulam, 1999; Pouget & Driver, 2000). And many studies have shown
that visual spatial attention is mainly dominated by the right hemi­
sphere (Corballis, 2003; DiNuzzo et al., 2022), particularly among righthanded individuals (Kinsbourne, 1977). These findings could explain
the exclusive predictive power of right-hemisphere alpha lateralization
for task performance. Notably, this does not negate the involvement of
the left hemisphere in spatial attention. Collectively, our findings pro­
vided new insights into alpha lateralization research: while traditional
analyses focus on contralateral versus ipsilateral responses, our data
suggest functional dominance of cerebral hemispheres that differ in
specific tasks.
In our study, we found a robust decrease in alpha lateralization at
350 ms after the target onset, which aligned with Diepen et al. (2016).
Moreover, when the previously attended but outdated information
reappeared, alpha lateralization is enhanced around 100 ms. The
enhancement of alpha band lateralization negatively correlated with
behavioral performance. It has been shown that lateralized changes in
alpha band power is related to the preparatory deployment of visual
spatial attention, which improves the processing of subsequent targets
and inhibits the processing of subsequent distractors (Doesburg et al.,
2016; Schneider et al., 2019; Worden et al., 2000). Alpha band lateral­
ization is also observed when observers perform search tasks (Forschack
et al., 2022; Foster et al., 2017; Hakim et al., 2021) or actively inhibit
distractors (Janssens et al., 2018). Based on the above literature and our
results, we proposed that alpha lateralization might reflect the pro­
cessing of the attention stimulus.

In summary, the present study demonstrated that attended but
outdated information is initially encoded into working memory, even
though it does not need to be remembered. Nevertheless, there are
several limitations and unaddressed issues that are important for future
research. First, it remains unclear whether attended but outdated in­
formation is temporarily inhibited or completely removed from memory
after being encoded, as inhibition may play a role in temporary removal
(Anderson & Hanslmayr, 2014; Lewis-Peacock et al., 2018). Despite no
significant memory trace was observed at later stages, our examination
of SOA was relatively limited, encompassing only five SOA conditions,
which cannot rule out the possibility of temporary inhibition at certain
time points. Future studies could explore more time points to investigate
the detailed temporal dynamics. Second, our experiments explored
changes in memory traces of attended but outdated information when
the stimulus presentation time was short, but did not explore them when
the memory items were presented for a long time. Therefore, it is unclear
whether the information will also be encoded into working memory
when the stimulus presentation time is long. This may require further
exploration using other measures and paradigms. Third, all participants
in our study were healthy young adults. A recent study found differences
in the ability of memory selection between adults and children (Fu et al.,
2024). Additionally, Gotts et al. (2013) discovered that the degree of
hemispheric lateralization in distinct systems selectively predicted
behavioral measures of distinct abilities, and the degree of hemispheric
lateralization changes with age (Cabeza et al., 1997; Holland et al.,
2001). Therefore, the ability to process such information may differ
across age groups, and thus these findings might not be directly gener­
alizable to different ages and populations. Finally, our findings are
reminiscent of the attribute amnesia effect (e.g., Chen & Wyble, 2015),
where participants were aware of the key feature but were unable to
report it, suggesting no memory traces of the attended but outdated
information. However, our study differed from Chen and Wyble (2015)
in three aspects: the attentional demands for key features (e.g., whether
color/shape feature judgment was required), no explicit reporting of key
features (assessing only implicit influence on search performance), and
the inclusion of shorter SOAs. Future studies could adapt Chen and
Wyble’s (2015) paradigm to test whether reduced SOAs allow explicit
reporting of attended but outdated features.
