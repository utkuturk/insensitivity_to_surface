Introduction
Language comprehension is not merely a bottom-up passive process
of waiting for words, but also involves actively generating top-down
predictions about what is likely to occur (Huettig, 2015; Kuperberg &
Jaeger, 2016; Pickering & Gambi, 2018), including predictions about
the form of the upcoming word (Ito, 2024). For bilinguals, this predic­
tion process is made more complicated because they can conduct
bottom-up and top-down processing in two languages. There is much
evidence that bilingual word recognition often involves the activation of
word forms from both the relevant (target) language and the irrelevant
(non-target) language (e.g., Dijkstra et al., 1998; Thierry & Wu, 2007),
in a language non-selective manner (Green, 1998). But we do not know
whether comprehenders predict word forms across languages.
We therefore asked whether bilinguals predict word forms in just the
target language that is currently in use (selective prediction) or whether
they predict in both the target and the non-target languages (non-selec­
tive prediction). Moreover, we asked whether non-selectivity depends on
whether they have recently encountered both languages (in a two-lan­
guage context) or just the target language (in a one-language context). To
address these questions, we examined whether highly proficient bilin­
gual speakers pre-activate the phonological representations of

predictable words in their first language (L1) while comprehending in
their second language (L2). We conducted two experiments in which
Mandarin Chinese-English bilinguals (i.e., L1 Mandarin) listened to
English sentences while looking at pictures and we monitored their eye
movements to determine what they were predicting.
Prediction within the target language
A substantial body of research demonstrates that L1 comprehenders
can predict many aspects of upcoming words, including meaning
(Altmann & Kamide, 1999; Dijkgraaf et al., 2019a; Grisoni et al., 2017),
syntax (Van Berkum et al., 2005; Wicha et al., 2004), and form (Ito et al.,
2018; Kukona, 2020; Li et al., 2022; Martin et al., 2013). For example,
Altmann and Kamide (1999) found that after hearing The boy will eat
the…, participants were more likely to look at an edible object (a cake)
than inedible objects (a ball, a toy train, and a toy car) before the word
cake was spoken, suggesting that participants pre-activated a component
of the meaning of the upcoming word (here, that it is edible). With re­
gard to form, Li et al. (2022) had L1 Mandarin Chinese speakers listen to
Mandarin sentences containing a highly predictable word (e.g., 放学了,
我把铅笔盒和本子装进了书包里准备回家 “After school, I put my pencil
case and notebooks into my schoolbag and get ready to go home”) while

viewing a scene containing a critical object whose Mandarin name (e.g.,
shu1zi5, meaning comb) shared the same initial syllable and tone (i.e., a
homophone) as the predictable word (shu1bao1, meaning schoolbag).
Participants fixated more on the Mandarin homophone competitor than
an unrelated object before the target word onset, demonstrating preactivation of the phonological information of the predictable word
(see also Ito et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024).
Together, these findings demonstrate that L1 comprehenders can
generate rich predictions at multiple levels. One influential account of
how such predictions are generated is the prediction-by-production
hypothesis (Dell & Chang, 2014; Pickering & Gambi, 2018; Pickering
& Garrod, 2013), which proposes that comprehenders use their own
production system to predict upcoming words. According to this ac­
count, they first derive the speaker’s intention by covertly imitating the
speaker’s utterance, and then pre-activate representations of the pre­
dictable word in the order of meaning, syntax, and phonology, mirroring
the stages of production, but without articulating.
The evidence for prediction during L2 comprehension is less clear
than the evidence for prediction during L1 comprehension. (At this
point, we discuss only within-language prediction.) Most studies have
found that L2 comprehenders predict semantics (e.g., Alemán Bañón &
Martin, 2024; Chun & Kaan, 2019; Dijkgraaf et al., 2019b; Lew-Williams
& Fernald, 2010) and syntax (e.g., Fang & Wu, 2024; Hopp & Lemmerth,
2018b), although they often predict less than L1 comprehenders (Hopp,
2015; Lew-Williams & Fernald, 2010; Mitsugi & Macwhinney, 2016;
Momenian et al., 2024; Schlenter, 2023; Schlenter & Felser, 2021; see
Kaan & Grüter, 2021 for a review).
The clearest difference between L1 and L2 prediction appears to
relate to form, as no study has found form prediction in L2 compre­
hension. For example, in an ERP study, Martin et al. (2013) had SpanishEnglish bilinguals and L1 English speakers read English sentences with a
predictable or unpredictable final noun, which was preceded by an
article either congruent or incongruent with the noun (as in DeLong
et al., 2005). L1 speakers, but not L2 speakers, showed an increased
N400 amplitude for articles incongruent with the predictable nouns,
suggesting that L2 speakers did not pre-activate the phonological rep­
resentation of predictable words. Similarly, Ito et al. (2017b) had
Spanish-English bilinguals read highly constraining L2 English senten­
ces that continued with a predictable word, a phonologically related
word, a semantically related word, or an unrelated word. Both phono­
logically and semantically related words elicited increased N400 effects
similar to those for non-predictable words but greater than for predict­
able words, suggesting that L2 speakers did not pre-activate the se­
mantic or form representations of the predictable words (see also Ito
et al., 2018, discussed below).

language activation comes from two broad types of studies: those
using language-ambiguous stimuli, in particular cognates and interlin­
gual homographs; and those using language-unambiguous stimuli.
Cognates
Facilitation for cognates (i.e., words sharing both meaning and form
across languages, such as taxi in English and Spanish), offers clear evi­
dence of parallel activation. Cognates are processed faster than noncognate controls in comprehension tasks such as lexical decision
(Dijkstra et al., 1998; Duyck et al., 2007; Van Hell & Dijkstra, 2002) and
progressive demasking (Dijkstra et al., 1999; Lemhöfer et al., 2008).
Similarly, in production, bilinguals name cognates faster than noncognates in picture naming tasks (Costa et al., 2000; Hoshino & Kroll,
2008) for review, see Costa et al., 2005). This facilitation in compre­
hension and production is often attributed to the co-activation of the
target word’s cognate in the non-target language, with converging
activation from both languages speeding processing.
There is some evidence that the strength and presence of cognate
facilitation depends on language context, although findings are mixed.
For example, Titone et al. (2011) found that English–French bilinguals
showed cognate facilitation during reading in low- but not highconstraint L1 (English) sentences. But when L2 (French) sentences
were also included (thereby creating a two-language context), facilita­
tion emerged even in high-constraint L1 sentences, suggesting that
cross-language activation is enhanced in a two-language context. In
contrast, Dijkstra et al. (2015) found that Dutch-English bilinguals
showed cognate facilitation in an L2 English lexical decision task
regardless of whether the cognates were preceded by Dutch or English
sentence context. Finally, Vanlangendonck et al. (2020) reported that in
an L2 lexical decision task, cognate facilitation turned into inhibition
when L1 items were included in the stimulus list. These three studies
therefore all showed very different patterns of results. Note, lexical de­
cision tasks involve metalinguistic judgments that may not be present in
natural sentence reading or listening.
Interlingual homographs
Interlingual homographs (words with the same orthography but
different meanings across languages) provide additional evidence for
cross-language activation. Bilinguals take longer to respond to inter­
lingual homographs than non-homographic controls in L2 lexical deci­
sion tasks (Dijkstra et al., 1998, 1999; Dijkstra et al., 2000; Schulpen
et al., 2003). This delay is often interpreted as evidence for the coactivation of both the form and meaning of homographs in the nontarget language (L1).
As with cognates, the interlingual homograph interference effect is
influenced by language context. For example, in Dijkstra et al.’s (1998)
English lexical decision task, there was no response time difference
between interlingual homographs and control words when only L2 En­
glish words or nonwords that were orthographically legal in English
were used (a one-language context). But when L1 Dutch filler words
were added (a two-language context), response times for homographs
were longer than for English control words (see also Dijkstra, Bruijn,
et al., 2000; Poort & Rodd, 2017). Similarly, Elston-Güttler et al. (2005)
presented German-English bilinguals with English sentences (e.g., The
woman gave her friend an expensive…) ending with either an interlingual
homograph (gift, meaning “poison” in German) or a control word (item),
followed by target words corresponding to the homograph’s L1 meaning
(poison). Participants who watched a German movie before the experi­
ment showed faster lexical decisions and N200/N400 modulations for
homograph-related targets in the first block—both effects absent for
those who watched an English movie, suggesting that cross-language
activation is influenced by language context (see also Elston-Güttler &
Gunter, 2009).
Evidence from production mirrors this pattern of results. Smits et al.

Cross-language activation and the effects of language context
As we have noted, our key questions are whether comprehenders
predict across languages (i.e., non-selectively) and whether any such
prediction is affected by language context. More specifically, we ask
whether they make L1 predictions when comprehending L2 utterances.
The main reason to hypothesize non-selective prediction is that there is
good evidence for non-selectivity in other aspects of language processing
(both comprehension and production), though this non-selectivity is
influenced by language context (see below).
Based on evidence that bilinguals show different code‑switching
patterns in production across contexts (i.e., mixing languages more
frequently in two‑language contexts than in one‑language contexts),
Grosjean (1998, 2001, 2008) proposed that the degree to which each
language is activated depends on the language context, as shaped by
factors such as the interlocutor, the communicative setting, and task
demands. When both L1 and L2 are in use (a two-language context),
both languages tend to remain active; when only one language is in use
(a one-language context), only the target language is typically activated.
Much of the evidence for this context-sensitive modulation of cross2

(2006) had Dutch-English bilinguals name interlingual homographs in
English. Naming latencies were longer for homographs than for nonhomographic control words when the stimuli included both Dutch and
English non-homographs (a two-language context), as well as homo­
graphs. However, this interference effect disappeared when the list
contained only homographs and English words (a one-language
context), suggesting that non-target language activation in production
emerges at least primarily in two-language contexts.

Hoversten & Martin, 2023), and so Spanish did not seem to be activated.
Production data also demonstrate effects of context on crosslanguage activation. In an fMRI study, Abutalebi et al. (2008) had
German-French bilinguals name pictures in either blocked con­
ditions—naming exclusively in L1 or L2 (a one-language context, with
respect to the block at least), or in mixed conditions that required
switching between L1 and L2 (a two-language context). Naming in L1
during the two-language context elicited greater activation in the left
caudate and anterior cingulate cortex (areas associated with inhibition)
compared to naming in L1 during the one-language context (see also
Guo et al., 2011). This suggests that the language that is not being
produced is more strongly activated in a two-language context than in a
one-language context.
In another cued picture-naming study, Olson (2016) had bilinguals
name pictures either in a context that was nearly one-language (with 95
% of trials in L1 and 5 % in L2, or vice versa) or a two-language context
(with 50 % of trials in each language). Asymmetrical switch costs (i.e.,
greater costs when switching into L1 than into L2) were observed in the
nearly one-language context but disappeared in the two-language
context. This pattern suggests that the non-target language is less
strongly inhibited in two-language contexts compared to nearly onelanguage contexts. In summary, the evidence from cognates, interlin­
gual homographs, and language-unambiguous stimuli suggest that
bilingual speakers often activate both languages during bottom-up
comprehension and language production. Moreover, such crosslanguage activation is affected by language context: Lexical access
tends to be language non-selective in a two-language context but more
selective in a one-language context.

Language-unambiguous stimuli
Beyond language-ambiguous stimuli such as cognates and interlin­
gual homographs, evidence for cross-language activation also comes
from studies using language-unambiguous stimuli—that is, L2 words
that do not have the same (or very similar) form to an L1 word, but
which nonetheless appear to trigger L1 activation during comprehen­
sion. First, Thierry and Wu (2007) had Mandarin-English bilinguals
judge the semantic relatedness of English word pairs (e.g., train – ham)
whose Mandarin translations (e.g., huo che – huo tui) shared a character,
and found reduced N400 amplitudes for these pairs in comparison to
English pairs whose Mandarin translations did not share a character.
They interpreted these results in terms of unconscious activation of
Mandarin translations during English comprehension (see also Wu &
Thierry, 2010; Zhang et al., 2011). Second, using the visual-world
paradigm, Wang et al. (2017) had Mandarin-English bilinguals listen
to English words (e.g., rain, “yu3” in Mandarin) while viewing a display
containing a target object, a competitor, and two unrelated distractors.
Participants were distracted by a competitor object (e.g., a feather, also
“yu3” in Mandarin) whose Mandarin name was a homophone of the
Mandarin translation of the target word in comparison to an unrelated
control. However, this effect did not occur when the competitor’s
Mandarin name shared all segments but differed in tone from the target
word (a fish, “yu2” in Mandarin), or when it shared rime and tone but
not onset (wheat, “gu3” in Mandarin). These results suggest that Man­
darin–English bilinguals automatically activate L1 translations,
including tone information, during L2 word processing.
As with language-ambiguous stimuli, cross-language activation from
language-unambiguous stimuli is affected by language context, as
shown in code-switching studies. For example, Cheng and Howard
(2008) presented Mandarin-Taiwanese bilinguals with pairs of Manda­
rin sentences that either both included some Taiwanese words (twolanguage context) or were entirely in Mandarin (one-language context)
and had them judge if two sentences were synonymous in Mandarin.
Participants showed a switch cost (i.e., were slower to respond) for
language-switching pairs only when they expected a monolingual
Mandarin context. When they expected that both Mandarin and
Taiwanese would be used in the experiment, the switch cost dis­
appeared. In an eye-tracking study, Olson (2017) had Spanish-English
bilinguals read a target word in English following a context that was
entirely in English, was entirely in Spanish, or consisted of some English
words followed by some Spanish words. Relative to the English-only
context, participants had more difficulty with a Spanish-only context,
but did not have difficulty with a mixed language context, suggesting
that the non-target language is activated to a larger extent in a twolanguage context than in a one-language context (see also Declerck &
Grainger, 2017; Kheder & Kaan, 2019).
Hoversten and Traxler (2020) had Spanish-English bilinguals read
low-constraint English sentences (e.g., We saw that his_had a horrible
scar) containing a critical word in English (hand), Spanish (mano), or a
pseudoword (erva). Eye movements revealed that overtly presented
Spanish words (two-language context) caused early reading disruptions
compared to English words, though less than pseudowords, suggesting
that code-switched words were less accessible but not fully treated as
pseudowords. However, when code-switched words were presented
covertly using the gaze-contingent boundary paradigm (arguably a onelanguage context), they were processed like pseudowords (see also

Evidence relating to cross-language prediction
Given the evidence for prediction in both monolinguals and bi­
linguals (using their L2), and for bottom-up cross-language activation in
bilinguals, we can ask whether bilinguals predict cross-linguistically,
and therefore whether prediction is language non-selective (Green,
1998). Such prediction could explain the reduced prediction effects for
bilinguals within L2 compared to monolinguals discussed above (Hopp
& Lemmerth, 2018b; Kaan, 2014; Schlenter, 2023). More importantly,
there is evidence that L2 speakers co-activate their L1 during L2 pre­
diction (i.e., non-selective prediction), including the activation of L1
semantic (e.g., Ito et al., 2024, 2025; van Bergen & Flecken, 2017) and
syntactic information (e.g., Alemán Bañón & Martin, 2021; Dussias
et al., 2013; Hopp & Lemmerth, 2018b).
But there is currently no evidence that bilinguals using L2 predict
word forms in L1 (i.e., the non-target language). For example, in an ERP
study, FitzPatrick and Indefrey (2010) had Dutch-English bilinguals
listen to high-constraining English sentences ending with semantically
incongruent words, predictable words, or words phonologically related
to the Dutch translations of predictable words (e.g., My Christmas present
came in a bright-orange doughnut”; doughnut had initial overlap with doos,
meaning “box”). There was no difference in the N400 peak or onset la­
tency between phonologically related words and incongruent words
(though incongruent words did differ from predictable words), sug­
gesting that the L1 phonological representations of the predictable
words were not activated during L2 comprehension.
Using the visual world paradigm, Ito et al. (2018) had JapaneseEnglish bilinguals listen to English sentences containing a highly pre­
dictable word (e.g., The tourists expected rain when the sun went behind the
cloud) while viewing a display with a critical object and three dis­
tractors. The critical object either corresponded to the predictable word
(e.g., cloud, “kumo” in Japanese), an English competitor (e.g., clown)
whose English name was phonologically related to the predictable word,
a Japanese competitor (bear; “kuma” in Japanese) whose Japanese name
was phonologically related to the Japanese translation of the predictable
word, or an unrelated object (e.g., globe). While participants showed
more anticipatory fixations to the target object, there was no difference
3

H. Yin and M.J. Pickering

in predictive looks between the Japanese competitor and the unrelated
object, nor between the English competitor and the unrelated object.
Thus, there was no evidence that L2 English speakers pre-activated
phonological representations of either the predictable English word or
its L1 Japanese translation.
This study used a one-language context (i.e., entirely English). Using
the same design, Amos et al. (2022) had L1 French translators and in­
terpreters listen to English sentences and simultaneously interpret them
into French while viewing a display containing a target object, an En­
glish phonological competitor, a French phonological competitor, or an
unrelated object. This task of course involves use of both languages (i.e.,
is a two-language context). Although both groups showed more pre­
dictive looks to the target object than to the unrelated object, neither
group did so for the English or French phonological competitors.
However, we cannot be certain that L1 phonological representations
of predictable words are not pre-activated during L2 comprehension,
especially given that phonological prediction effects are often small and
therefore difficult to detect (see Ito, 2024). For example, in Ito et al.
(2018), Japanese competitors and Japanese translations of predictable
words shared only 2.6 out of 4.9 phonemes on average (53 %), which
may not have been sufficient to trigger activation of phonologically
related words. Additionally, the study had low power (96 observations
per condition in Ito et al., 2018), as did Amos et al. (2022) (192 per
condition), though note that visual-world studies typically involve far
fewer observations per condition (e.g., 192 in Altmann & Kamide, 1999,
Experiments 1 and 2; and only 18 in Tanenhaus et al., 1995 and Spivey
et al., 2002) than response-time experiments.
In sum, existing research does not provide clear evidence that
bilingual speakers pre-activate L1 phonological representations of pre­
dictable words during L2 comprehension. Moreover, since most exper­
iments concerning prediction have been conducted in one-language
contexts, we do not know whether lexical access during predictive
processing is language selective, non-selective, or context-dependent.

cross-language L1 phonological activation. In contrast, studies using
Mandarin homophones have reliably detected L1 phonological activa­
tion during L1 comprehension (Li et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2024). Xu et al.
(2024) had 288 observations per condition and Li et al. (2022) had 450.
We decided to have 360 observations per condition, with each partici­
pant viewing 12 items per condition. (We acknowledge that our studies
have low power and supplemented our analyses with Bayesian model­
ling that quantified relative evidence for the alternative versus the null
model to assess the strength of evidence for the alternative over the null
hypothesis; see Methods for details).
Our participants heard English sentences containing a highly pre­
dictable word (e.g., rain in You should take an umbrella with you, because
there will be heavy rain at three o’clock this afternoon) while viewing a
display which contained three distractors and a critical object (see
Fig. 1). The critical object corresponded to the target word (e.g., rain
[Mandarin: yu3]), a Mandarin homophone competitor whose Mandarin
name was a homophone (e.g., feather [Mandarin: yu3]) of the Mandarin
translation of the predictable word, or a word (e.g., comb [Mandarin:
shu1]) that was unrelated to the predictable word.
We assume that participants predict components of the meaning of
highly predictable words in L2 sentences, and therefore hypothesize that
they will fixate the target objects more than unrelated objects before the
target word onset. The critical question is whether they pre-activate L1
phonological representations of predictable words in L2 sentences. If
they do, they should fixate more on Mandarin homophone objects than
on unrelated objects before the target word onset. Experiment 1 inves­
tigated these issues using a one-language context (where filler sentences
were in English), and Experiment 2 did so using a two-language context
(where filler sentences were in Mandarin).
Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, the whole experimental session was conducted in
English. The only use of Mandarin was in a familiarization session (see
below).

The present study

Methods

Our study investigated whether bilinguals comprehending sentences
in their L2 make lexical predictions in their L1. To do so, we conducted
two visual-world eye-tracking experiments. We examined whether
Mandarin-English bilinguals listening to English predict in both Man­
darin and English or whether they restrict predictions to English. Also,
we explored whether such predictions occur when they heard only En­
glish (one-language context, Experiment 1) or both Mandarin and En­
glish (two-language context, Experiment 2).
Our experiments were related to Ito et al. (2018), but differ in both
research focus and methodology. Theoretically, our research aims were
to investigate whether L2 speakers pre-activate L1 form representations
of predictable words during L2 comprehension, and whether any such
cross-language prediction depends on language context. Therefore, we
included only three conditions, excluding the English phonologically
related condition from Ito et al. (2018), and in addition, we conducted
Experiment 2 using a two-language context.
Methodologically, our study differed from Ito et al. (2018) in two
ways. First, to enhance the likelihood of detecting L1 phonological
activation, we used (intralingual) homophones in Mandarin as L1
phonological competitors. Mandarin has an abundance of homo­
phones—words with identical pronunciations but different meanings
and spellings. Compared to the L1 phonological competitors used by Ito
et al. (2018), our use of homophones greatly increased the phonological
overlap with the Mandarin translations of predictable words. We
assumed that this would maximize the likelihood of detecting crosslanguage L1 phonological activation, provided that L1 Mandarin
translations of predictable words are indeed activated during L2 English
comprehension. The second difference from Ito et al. (2018) was an
increased sample size. As noted, Ito et al. (2018) had 96 observations per
condition and Amos et al. (2022) had 192, but neither study observed

Participants
Thirty Mandarin Chinese students at the University of Edinburgh (5
males and 25 females), aged between 21 and 28 years (M = 23.37, SD =
1.61) participated in this experiment. All participants were native
Mandarin Chinese speakers with English as their L2. They had all lived
in the UK for at least 5 months and were currently studying in the UK at
the time of the experiment. Each participant received a payment of £9
for their participation. After the main experiment, participants were
asked to indicate their scores on International English Language Testing
System, the age at which they began learning English, the daily duration
of their English use, and their immersion length in an English-speaking
country. Additionally, they were asked to self-rate their English profi­
ciency in reading, writing, speaking, and listening separately on a scale
from 1 (not good at all) to 7 (very good); see Table 1.
Stimuli
We created 36 pairs of English sentences (see Appendix 1) involving
a highly predictable target noun (underlined), for example You should
take an umbrella with you because there will be heavy rain at three o’clock
this afternoon and Many birds, like parrots and peacocks, have beautiful and
colorful feathers that make them very exotic and eye-catching. The Man­
darin translation of the predictable word from one member of the pair
(here, rain, with translation yu3) was homophonous with the Mandarin
translation of the predictable word from the other member of the pair
(here, feathers, also with translation yu3). The experimental sentences
had a mean length of 23.9 words (SD = 3.1, range = 17–31 words), and

this afternoon”. Note. The object depicted at the top right corner is the critical object for this item. The visual stimuli were also paired with the filler sentence ‘‘When
my brother and I were playing in the street, we lost 200 lb, and we don’t want our mum to know that”.

3.67 syllables per second. This configuration was chosen because it
produced audio that closely resembled a native British English speaker,
as confirmed by three further Mandarin-English bilinguals from the
University of Edinburgh.
Each of the sentences was paired with a scene containing four ob­
jects: a critical object and three distractors. In the target condition, the
critical object corresponded to the target word (e.g., rain [Mandarin:
yu3]). In the Mandarin homophone condition, the Mandarin name of the
critical object was a homophone of the Mandarin translation of the
target word (e.g., feather [Mandarin: yu3]). English and Mandarin names
of the Mandarin homophone objects were both unrelated to any of the
English names of the target and unrelated objects. In the unrelated
condition, the name of the critical object was neither phonologically nor
semantically related to the predictable word (e.g., comb [Mandarin:
shu1zi0]). The unrelated condition served as a baseline. English and
Mandarin names of each critical object had no phonemes in common. An
example item with four conditions is shown in Fig. 1.
For the two versions of sentence contexts in each homophone pair,
the target object in the target condition for one sentence context was
used as the Mandarin homophone object for the other sentence context
in the Mandarin homophone condition, and vice versa. In the unrelated
condition, these two sentence contexts were paired with two different
unrelated objects, which were also used as a target or homophone object
in other trials. This design ensured counterbalancing, and allowing each
critical object to alternate between roles across conditions for a more
controlled comparison.
A further 28 Mandarin-English bilinguals from the University of
Edinburgh participated in a name agreement test for the critical objects:
Of these, 14 provided the first Mandarin name that came to their mind
for each picture, and the other 14 provided the English name. In the
English-naming norming task, the instructions were in English
throughout the test. In the Mandarin-naming norming task, the in­
structions were in Mandarin throughout the test. The Mandarin and
English naming agreement for the retained critical objects was 86.71 %
(SD = 15.90, range = 50 %–100 %) and 88.89 % (SD = 14.48, range =
50 %–100 %) respectively.
All the visual stimuli were shown twice, once in an experimental trial
and once in a filler trial. The matched visual stimuli for an experimental
and filler recording contained the same four objects, but the quadrant in

the predictable word appeared at different positions in each sentence
(range = 10th-25th word, M = 16.6, SD = 3.0) but never sentencefinally.
Target-word predictability was assessed using a cloze-probability
test. Fourteen further Mandarin-English bilinguals who were studying
in the UK were presented with sentence fragments which were truncated
immediately before the target word, and were asked to complete each
sentence with the first word that came to mind. The cloze probability of
a word was defined as the percentage of participants who used the exact
word to complete the sentence. The mean cloze probability of the target
word was 88.08 % (SD = 12.54, range = 61.54 %–100 %). There were an
additional 36 English filler sentences (e.g., When my brother and I were
playing in the street, we lost 200 lb, and we don’t want our mum to know
that) with a similar length to the experimental sentences (M = 24.0, SD =
3.5, range = 20–34 words) but were not designed to have a highly
predictable word.
The sentences were generated using Murf AI voice generator, a text
to speech software which can produce human-like and natural-sounding
voice. These sentences were generated with the synthesized voice which
was set as “English-UK-Edward (M), middle-aged, general tone, pitch (0
%), speed (− 50 %)” (https://murf.ai/studio/project/2/P01702636

ulation in either Experiment 1 or 2.

paired with fillers in the other half-list, and vice versa. Experimental
pictures were counterbalanced across the full lists, resulting in three
different sets of items and a total of 12 experimental lists (six lists for
each version of sentence context in a homophone pair). The order of the
sentences within each block was randomized for each participant and
the whole experiment took approximately 35 min, with participants
having four breaks during the session.
Critical objects appeared in each quadrant equally frequently. Filler
sentences mentioned one of the three distractor objects in the visual
display 2/3 of the time. Thus, in total 50 % of sentences mentioned an
object in the visual display.

Data analyses
Two items were excluded from the eye-tracking analyses in Experi­
ment 1, because the target object for these items attracted more looks
than the unrelated objects within 1000 ms after the picture onset when
the pictures were presented with a neutral sentence that was unrelated
to the target objects in filler trials (see the analysis for filler trials below;
Ito et al. 2018 used similar ways). This left 34 items for the analyses.
Following Ito et al. (2018), we began by analyzing the fixation on the
critical objects for the filler sentences (without having analyzed the
experimental sentences) and two items showed many more looks to the
target object than the unrelated object. Indeed, the analysis of all the
filler items showed that participants looked at the target object more
than the unrelated object. When we removed the two items, the analysis
now showed no difference in fixations toward the target objects and the
unrelated objects.
In both Experiment 1 and 2, we first analyzed the eye-tracking data
using generalized linear mixed-effects models (Baayen et al., 2008) with
the lme4 package (Bates et al., 2015) in R (R Core Team, 2020). The
fixations on critical objects (target, Mandarin homophone, and unre­
lated objects) were coded binomially (fixated = 1, not fixated = 0) in
each 50 ms bin from 1000 ms before to 1000 ms after the target word
onset. If fixations fell in the area of 300 × 300 pixels around a picture,
they were regarded as falling on it. Blinks and fixations outside the in­
terest areas were coded as 0 and were included in the data. The model
used binomially coded fixation as the dependent variable, predicted by
condition. The condition variable was dummy-coded, with the unrelated
condition set as the reference level. Thus, we could test effects of each
critical condition relative to the unrelated (baseline) condition (target
vs. unrelated, Mandarin homophone vs. unrelated). The model included
random intercepts by participants and by items (Baayen et al., 2008).
Random slopes were not included because the models with them did not
converge for several of the time bins. As in Ito et al. (2018), we deter­
mined whether a critical condition significantly differed from the
baseline condition by assessing if there was a period with at least three
consecutive bins showing significant differences.
But this approach has two limitations. First, fixations in adjacent
time bins are highly correlated, because the eye-tracker records a fixa­
tion at every millisecond, but fixations usually last for a few hundreds of
milliseconds (Ito & Knoeferle, 2023; Rayner, 1998). Second, the binned
analysis was conducted in many time bins and therefore involved mul­
tiple comparisons, and so it increases the chance of Type 1 error
(Hochberg, 1987). To address these issues, we additionally conducted a
cluster-based permutation analysis for the time period from − 1000 ms
before until 1000 ms after target word onset, which controls for auto­
correlation of eye-movement across neighboring time bins and over­
comes the multiple comparisons issue.
Given the possibility that our study may be underpowered, we
additionally analyzed our data using Bayesian generalized mixed-effects
models in 50 ms time bins from − 1000 ms to 1000 ms relative to target
word onset (in both Experiment 1 and 2). These models were imple­
mented using the brms package (version 2.20.4) in R. We used weakly
informative priors to regularize estimates. Fixed-effect coefficients for
condition were given Normal (0,1) priors on the log-odds scale, grouplevel standard deviations were given Normal (0,1) priors, and the
model intercept was assigned Student-t (3,0,2.5). These choices follow
common practice for logistic regression models in brms. To quantify the
evidence for our specific hypotheses (Target vs. Unrelated, and Homo­
phone vs. Unrelated), we conducted model comparison using Bayes
Factors (BF10) calculated via bridge sampling. For each comparison, we
contrasted a full model that included the effect of interest (M1) against a
null-hypothesis model (M0) where that specific effect was absent. The

Procedure
Participants were tested in a laboratory at the University of Edin­
burgh, and the whole session had three parts: the picture-familiarization
task, the eye-tracking experiment, and the language-background
questionnaire.
In the picture-familiarization task, participants were shown 180
objects (72 critical objects and 108 distractor objects) one by one on a
screen, each accompanied by its English and Mandarin names displayed
horizontally below. The name order was counterbalanced: For half the
pictures, English names appeared on the left and Mandarin names on the
right, and vice versa for the other half. Participants were told to
memorize both the Mandarin and English names for each object. Once
they indicated that they had remembered all the names, the pictures
were shown again without the names, and participants were asked to
name each object in both Mandarin and English using the previously
given names. To balance positional effects, participants first articulated
the Mandarin names for pictures with English names on the left, fol­
lowed by the English names, and vice versa for pictures with Mandarin
names on the left. The mean picture naming accuracy on the first pre­
sentation was 92.41 %. The high accuracy suggests that the pictures
were familiar to our participants and were relatively easy to associate
with the intended names. If they did not respond correctly with both the
English and Mandarin names for a picture, that picture was presented
again in another picture-familiarization session (until all pictures were
named correctly).
The experimenter used solely English for all communication,
including greetings and instructions, and participants were also told to
respond only in English. In addition, all instructions displayed on the
screen and filler sentences were in English. Thus, the experiment pro­
vided an entirely one-language context, except for the familiarization
session.
In the eye-tracking experiment, participants were seated in front of a
computer screen, at a distance of about 60 cm. Participants’ right eye
movements were recorded using an SR Research EyeLink® 1000 mount
eye-tracker with a sample rate of 500 Hz. Participants were instructed to
listen carefully to each sentence and judge whether it mentioned any of
the objects on the screen after the sentences ended. Before the experi­
ment, participants put their chin on a chin rest, and the eye-tracker was
calibrated using a nine-point calibration grid. The experiment began
with two practice trials, followed by a break in which participants could
ask questions. The pictures were displayed on a screen with a resolution
of 1024 × 768 pixels. Each trial started with a drift correction, followed
by a 500 ms blank screen. On experimental trials, the visual scene was
presented 1000 ms before the onset of predictable words in experi­
mental trials. In filler trials, the scene appeared 1000 ms before the onset
of a word referring to a distractor object or at an arbitrary mid-sentence
position if the sentence did not mention any of the objects. The picture
remained on the screen for 750 ms after sentence offset, at which point it
was replaced with the question “Did the sentence mention any of the
pictures?”. Participants indicated their answers by pressing the left
button for “No” and the right button for “Yes”, using a button box, and
the next trial began immediately after the response. No feedback was
given during the experiment. The session took about 40 min. At the end,

resulting BF10 quantifies the evidence for M1 over M0. A BF10 less than 1
provides evidence in favor of M0; values between 1 and 3 suggest weak
evidence for M1; values above 3 indicate moderate evidence for M1; and
values above 10 indicate strong evidence for M1 (Lee & Wagenmakers,
2014).

Mandarin homophone objects, and unrelated objects in the time window
from − 1000 ms before to 1000 ms after target word onset. Time was
synchronized to target word onset.
The binned generalized linear mixed-effects models showed that
bilinguals were more likely to fixate on target objects than on unrelated
objects from − 650 ms before they heard the target word until (at least)
1000 ms after the target word onset. However, from − 1000 ms before to
at least 1000 ms after the target word onset, there was no fixation bias
toward Mandarin homophone objects compared to unrelated objects. In
fact, participants fixated more on unrelated objects than on homophone
objects during two time bins: − 100 ms to − 50 ms and − 50 ms to 0 ms.
Consistent with the results from the generalized mixed-effects
models, the Bayesian generalized mixed-effects models showed that
the BF10 for the contrast between target and unrelated objects exceeded
1 after − 750 ms, 3 after − 700 ms, and was consistently above 10 from
− 650 ms until 1000 ms after target onset (when recording finished),
therefore indicating strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis (a

fixation preference toward the target) over the null. In contrast, the BF10
for the homophone versus unrelated comparison remained below 1 (see
Appendix 2 for exact values) both before and after the target word onset
(except at − 100 to 0 ms, where BF10 favored models for more fixations
to the unrelated than to the homophone object), showing evidence for
the null model (no fixation bias toward Mandarin homophones).
The cluster-based permutation analysis showed that target objects
attracted more fixations than unrelated objects in the time window from
− 700 ms before to 1000 ms1 after the target word onset (cluster-mass =
6917, p < 0.001). Mandarin homophone objects received more fixations
than unrelated objects from − 900 ms to − 800 ms before the target word
onset (cluster-mass = 26.4, p < 0.001), which, based on the visual plot
(see Fig. 2) and the fact that it occurred very soon after picture pre­
sentation and before the target-object effect began, was interpreted as
fixation noise. From time − 100 ms to − 50 ms, participants fixated more
on unrelated objects than on homophone objects (cluster-mass = 11.8, p
= 0.045).
We also analyzed the filler trials in order to examine whether there
was any visual bias towards critical objects irrespective of the predictive
contexts. As reported above, two items were removed. Both the gener­
alized mixed-effects model analysis and the cluster-based permutation
analysis showed no significant fixation bias toward target objects or
Mandarin homophone objects than unrelated objects.

Mandarin and English were used.
Method
Participants
Thirty further participants from the same population as Experiment 1
(3 males and 29 females) aged 21–28 (M = 23.37 years, SD = 1.47) took
part in this experiment. After the main experiment, participants were
also asked to indicate their language history and English proficiency; see
Table 1. There were no significant differences in language history or
proficiency between the participants in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2
(all p > .05).
Stimuli and procedure
To ensure a two-language context, the experimenter greeted partic­
ipants and talked to them only in Mandarin throughout the whole
experiment; the instructions for the experiment were in Mandarin; we
translated 2/3 of the filler sentences from Experiment 1 into Mandarin,
with half of them containing a “YES” answer and the other half con­
taining a “NO” answer. The remaining 1/3 filler sentences from Exper­
iment 1 were still in English, with all of them containing a “YES” answer.
Like the English experimental and filler sentences, the Mandarin filler
sentences were generated using the Murf AI voice generator. The syn­
thesized voice was set to “Mandarin-China-Zhang (Male), middle-aged,
general tone, pitch (0 %), speed (− 20 %)”, resulting in a speech rate of
4.98 syllables per second. Two additional Mandarin-English bilinguals
from the University of Edinburgh rated these Mandarin filler sentences
as both comprehensible and natural. All audio files were downloaded in
high-quality WAV format.
Overall, filler sentences mentioned one of the three distractor objects
in the visual display 2/3 of the time, so together with the experimental
sentences (which mentioned one of the four objects 1/3 of the time), 50
% of sentences mentioned an object in the visual scene. The experi­
mental materials and other procedures remained the same as Experi­
ment 1. The mean picture naming accuracy on the first presentation was
94.32 %.

Discussion
Experiment 1 investigated whether bilinguals pre-activate L1
phonological representations of predictable words during L2 compre­
hension when only L2 was needed throughout the experiment (except
for the familiarization session). Mandarin-English participants made
predictive fixations on target objects more than unrelated objects before
hearing the target words. This suggests that participants predicted the
L2 target words or their meanings, aligning with prior research
demonstrating L2 speakers’ ability to predict target words or their
meaning during L2 comprehension (e.g., Dijkgraaf et al., 2017; Ito,
Pickering, et al., 2018). Crucially, however, they did not show more
fixations on Mandarin homophone objects than unrelated objects. This
suggests that while participants predicted the L2 target words or their
meanings, they did not pre-activate L1 representations of predictable
words in a one-language (L2) context.
It is also worth noting that participants showed no fixation difference
between Mandarin homophone objects and unrelated objects even after
hearing the target word. This is consistent with evidence suggesting that
lexical access during bottom-up language comprehension is language
selective (restricted to the target language) in a one-language context (e.
g., Dijkstra et al., 1999; Hoversten & Traxler, 2020).
Given the evidence that cross-language activation is more likely to
occur in two-language contexts than one-language contexts, the absence
of L1 lexical pre-activation during L2 comprehension in Experiment 1 is
not surprising. We now ask whether participants pre-activate L1 lexical
representations of predictable words during L2 comprehension in a twolanguage context (where both languages are encountered)? To address
this, Experiment 2 used the same experimental materials and procedure
as Experiment 1 but now included two-thirds of fillers and all instruction
and conversation in L1 Mandarin.

Results
Comprehension question accuracy and eye-tracking data
The mean accuracy for the comprehension questions in the experi­
mental trials was 97.93 % (SD = 14.22 %). The bottom part of Fig. 2
shows bilinguals’ proportions of fixations on target objects, Mandarin
homophone objects, and unrelated objects in a two-language context.
The eye-tracking data were analyzed using the same procedures as in
Experiment 1. Two items were excluded from the eye-tracking analyses
in Experiment 2, because in the filler trials that used the same target and
Mandarin homophone objects, those objects attracted more looks than
the unrelated object within 1000 ms before the picture onset (see filler
trial analysis below). This left 34 items for the analyses. We analyzed
fixations on the critical objects for the filler sentences using the same
procedure as in Experiment 1. After we removed two items, the analysis
showed no difference in fixations toward the target objects, homophone
objects, and the unrelated objects.
The binned generalized mixed-effects model showed that partici­
pants fixated target objects more than unrelated objects from − 650 ms
before they heard the target word until at least 1000 ms after the target
word onset. Critically, participants also fixated more on Mandarin ho­
mophone objects than on unrelated objects from − 250 ms before to
− 100 ms (three consecutive time bins) before the target word onset and
from 150 ms to 300 ms (three consecutive time bins) after the target
word onset.

findings. Consistent with the results from the generalized mixed-effects
models, the Bayesian generalized mixed-effects models showed that the
BF10 for the contrast between target and unrelated objects exceeded 1
after − 700 ms, 3 after − 650 ms, and was consistently above 10 from
− 600 ms before target-word onset until recording finished at 1000 ms
after target-word onset, therefore indicating strong evidence for a fixa­
tion preference toward the target. For the homophone vs. unrelated
comparison (see Appendix 3 for BF10 values at all time bins), the BF10
exceeded 3 at − 250 ms (BF10 = 4.54) and − 200 ms (BF10 = 4.72), and
remained above 1 until − 100 ms before target word onset. (A BF10
above 1 also occurred at 200 ms and 300 ms, and above 3 occurred at
250 ms after target word onset). These patterns suggest that participants
showed a fixation bias toward the homophone object relative to the
unrelated object before target word onset (− 250 ms to − 100 ms), as
well as after target-word onset (200 ms to 300 ms). But note that this
homophone fixation bias was smaller, emerged later, and was shorterlived than the robust target fixation bias.
Finally, the cluster-based permutation analysis further confirmed
these effects. Target objects attracted more fixations than unrelated
objects in the time window from − 750 ms before to 1000 ms after the
target word onset (cluster-mass = 6577, p < 0.001). Importantly,
Mandarin homophone objects received more fixations than unrelated
objects in the time window from − 300 ms to − 50 ms before the target
word (cluster-mass = 61.3, p < 0.001), and also in the time window from
150 ms to 450 ms after the target word onset (cluster-mass = 51.5, p <
0.001).
We also analyzed the filler trials in order to examine whether there
was any visual bias towards critical objects irrespective of the predictive
contexts. As reported above, two items were removed. Both the gener­
alized mixed-effects model analysis and the cluster-based permutation
analysis showed no significant fixation bias toward target objects or
Mandarin homophone objects than unrelated objects.

Experiment 2 (the two-language context) participants made signifi­
cantly more fixations on the homophone objects than in Experiment 1
(the one-language context) during the –200 to –50 ms window before
the target word onset (cluster-mass = 53.8, p < 0.001). The combined
analysis suggests that bilinguals in a two-language context pre-activated
L1 translations of predictable words to a larger extent than those in a
one-language context.
General Discussion
We investigated whether L1 phonological representation of pre­
dictable words are pre-activated during L2 comprehension in a onelanguage context (Experiment 1, where only L2 English was used
except for the familiarization session) and a two-language context
(Experiment 2, where both English and Mandarin were used
throughout). In both experiments, participants fixated more on target
objects than on unrelated objects before the target word onset. In the
two-language context, participants also fixated more on objects whose
Mandarin names were homophones of the Mandarin translations of
predictable words than unrelated objects, both before and after the
target word onset. However, this effect was not observed in the onelanguage context.
Evidence for cross-language prediction during L2 comprehension
In the two-language context, participants made predictive fixations
toward Mandarin homophone objects before the target word onset. This
provides evidence that bilingual speakers can pre-activate L1 translation
equivalents of predictable words during L2 comprehension.
Our findings contrast with those of Amos et al. (2022) and Ito et al.
(2018), both of whom reported that L2 speakers did not make predictive
eye movements toward L1 phonological competitors before the target
word onset. Several methodological differences might explain the
discrepancy. Compared with Ito et al. (2018), we used Chinese homo­
phones that provided complete phonological overlap with L1 picture
names (rather than partial overlap in Ito et al., 2018), included a picture
familiarization phase that presented participants with both L1 (Man­
darin) and L2 (English) names for each picture (whereas Ito et al., 2018
presented only L2 names), collected considerably more observations per
condition, and manipulated the language context. Although any one of
these factors could have contributed to the difference between our re­
sults and those of Ito et al. (2018), we consider language context the
most compelling explanation. Our Experiment 1, which used a onelanguage context similar to Ito et al. (2018), produced no evidence of
cross-language prediction. Crucially, cross-language prediction emerged
only in Experiment 2, where we introduced additional L1 elements (i.e.,
the instructions, conversation, and two-thirds of the fillers), suggesting
that the use of two-language contexts promoted predictive activation of
L1.
However, the discrepancies between our findings and those of Amos
et al. (2022) likely stem from different reasons. Like our study, Amos
et al. (2022) presented bilingual participants with both L1 and L2 pic­
ture names during familiarization. More importantly, their participants
were also placed in a two-language context by constantly interpreting or
translating from L2 to L1. Yet, they found no evidence for the preactivation of L1 translation equivalents of predictable words. This
divergence may be due to the high cognitive load experienced by par­
ticipants in their study. The interpreting task might have taxed partici­
pants so much that insufficient resources remained for L1 form
prediction, considering that cognitive resources are crucial for predic­
tion (Pickering & Gambi, 2018). Alternatively, the overlap between the
L1 French phonological competitors and L1 French translations of pre­
dictable words in their study may have been too small to affect partic­
ipants’ eye movements, even if some pre-activation of L1 translations
did occur. It is also possible that their experiment had too few obser­
vations per condition to detect any effect.

Discussion
Experiment 2 investigated whether bilinguals pre-activate L1
phonological representations of predictable words during L2 compre­
hension when both their L1 and L2 were used. We found that MandarinEnglish participants fixated more on target objects than unrelated ob­
jects before hearing the target words. Critically, they were more likely to
fixate on Mandarin homophone objects than unrelated objects, both
before and after the target word onset. These findings suggest that in a
two-language context, participants not only pre-activated the highly
predictable target words (or their meaning), but also pre-activated the
L1 translations of predictable words during L2 comprehension.
Comparison of Experiment 1 and 2
Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 tested whether bilingual speakers
pre-activated L1 representations of predictable words during L2
comprehension in a one-language and two-language contexts, respec­
tively. Participants showed a cross-language L1 prediction effect in
Experiment 2 but not in Experiment 1, suggesting an effect of language
context on cross-language prediction. To verify the role of language
context, we combined data from both experiments and conducted a
cluster-based permutation analysis from 1000 ms before to 1000 ms
after the target word onset, with the effect of language context sumcoded and the condition dummy-coded, using the unrelated condition
as the reference level.
The analysis showed that participants fixated more on the target
objects than the unrelated objects in the time window from − 800 ms
before to at least 1000 ms after the target word onset, in both Experi­
ment 1 and 2 (cluster-mass = 13303, p < 0.001). They also fixated more
on the Mandarin homophone object than the unrelated object in the time
windows from − 350 to − 200 ms (cluster-mass = 30.4, p < 0.001), and
from 150 to 400 ms (cluster-mass = 55.9, p < 0.001). Crucially, in

Note that participants’ greater fixations to target than to unrelated
objects before target word onset indicate prediction of the L2 target
words or their meanings, but do not, by themselves, demonstrate preactivation of L2 phonological forms. Our finding that L2 speakers preactivate the L1 phonological representations is, therefore, compatible
with the possibility that previous failures to observe L2 form prediction
(Amos et al., 2022; FitzPatrick & Indefrey, 2010; Ito et al., 2018) may
partly reflect interference from L1. However, because L1 form coactivation in our data occurred only in the two-language context but
not in a one-language context, L1 interference cannot fully account for
the absence of L2 form prediction in purely one-language studies (e.g.,
Ito et al., 2018). An additional explanation is that pre-activating L2 form
representations is especially resource-demanding: reduced automaticity
in L2 comprehension and production may leave fewer cognitive re­
sources available for L2 form prediction (Ito & Pickering, 2021). But as
our experiments did not include an L2 phonological competitor (as in Ito
et al. 2018), we cannot be sure whether L2 phonological forms are preactivated. Future work could include both L1 and L2 phonological
competitors and manipulate context and cognitive load to establish
whether L2 form prediction occurs, and if not, whether its absence re­
flects L1 interference or resource limitations.

Cross-language lexical prediction mechanism
Although we found evidence that bilinguals pre-activate L1 repre­
sentations of predictable words during L2 comprehension, it remains
unclear whether they directly pre-activated L1 lexical representations of
predictable words, or they first pre-activated L2 lexical representations,
which then activated their L1 translation equivalents. If bilinguals
directly pre-activate L1 lexical representations, potentially alongside L2
representations, this would suggest that predictive processing is inher­
ently language-nonselective. In this case, bilinguals make predictions in
both their L1 and L2 simultaneously. Within the framework of the
prediction-by-production account (Pickering & Gambi, 2018), bilingual
speakers would use their production systems to pre-activate lexical
forms in both languages, mirroring the lexical access process in bilingual
speech production. In contrast, if L2 lexical representations are preactivated first and L1 representations are subsequently activated
(either via shared semantic links or direct translation connections), this
would suggest that predictive processing is initially language-selective.
If so, L1 activation would reflect post-lexical co-activation, a byproduct rather than a core component of prediction.
A third possibility is that bilinguals initially pre-activate L1 lexical
representations, which then activate their L2 translations. This route
may be favored when L1 words are more easily accessible or less
cognitively demanding to retrieve, which may be especially relevant
when L2 lexical prediction is resource-intensive. On this account, preactivating L1 words may serve as a cognitive shortcut to facilitate L2
comprehension. Future research might distinguish among these possi­
bilities by comparing the time course of fixations to L1 and L2 phono­
logical competitors. If bilinguals directly pre-activate L1 lexical
representations, fixations on the L1 competitor might emerge earlier
than those on the L2 competitor, or L2 fixations may be absent alto­
gether. If L1 is activated via L2, however, fixations on the L1 competitor
might emerge later than those on the L2 competitor.

Cross-language prediction and language context
Our study revealed a clear influence of language context on predic­
tive processing: Participants made predictive fixations toward L1 Man­
darin homophone objects only in a two-language context, but not in a
one-language setting. This strongly suggests that phonological activa­
tion during predictive processing is highly sensitive to the language
context. Bilinguals in two-language contexts appear to activate repre­
sentations of predictable words in both languages, whereas in onelanguage contexts, they restrict activation to the target language. This
prediction pattern is consistent with evidence that lexical access is more
language non-selective in two- than one-language contexts, across both
comprehension and production.
The similarity in cross-language activation patterns between pre­
diction and production suggests that these processes may share mech­
anisms governing how lexical access is modulated by language context.
This pattern is broadly consistent with the prediction-by-production
hypothesis, which proposes that prediction during comprehension en­
gages the production system (Dell & Chang, 2014; Pickering & Gambi,
2018; Pickering & Garrod, 2013). On this account, comprehenders use
their production systems to pre-activate representations of predictable
word in the order of meaning, syntax, and phonology, much like in
production, but without articulation. If lexical selectivity in production
is context-dependent, and prediction recruits the production system,
then lexical selectivity during prediction would likewise be expected to
vary with language context—a pattern compatible with our results. We
stress, however, that this interpretation is tentative, as our data do not
directly demonstrate production system involvement.
So, how exactly does language context influence lexical access in
prediction? In our study, the two-language context in which L1 filler
sentences were included, participants encountered L1 and L2 sentences
apparently randomly, creating uncertainty about the language of up­
coming words. This led to non-selective predictions, with participants
activating L1 representations of predictable words while using their
production system for prediction. In contrast, in the one-language
context, where only L2 sentences were included, participants were
quite certain that they would only hear L2 sentences, leading them to
expect that the upcoming predictable word would be in L2. This
language-specific certainty led to selective predictions, with the pre­
diction system activating only L2 representations, thus avoiding the coactivation of L1 representations.

Conclusion
We reported two visual-world eye-tracking experiments that inves­
tigated whether highly proficient L2 speakers pre-activate L1 translation
equivalents of predictable words during L2 comprehension. We found
that bilingual speakers pre-activated L1 phonological representations of
predictable words during L2 comprehension, but such cross-language
lexical predictions only occurred in a two-language context where
both L1 and L2 were relevant for the task, but not in a one-language
context where only L2 was needed for the task. These findings suggest
that whether lexical predictions are language-selective depends on
language context.
