## Theoretical Framing Patterns

### Introducing Competing Theories

JML papers often frame research in terms of competing theoretical accounts:

#### Setting Up the Debate
> "Two broad classes of models have been proposed to account for..."

> "The evidence is mixed: While some studies have found..., others have reported..."

> "This has become a matter of debate between proponents of X and advocates of Y."

#### Presenting Theory A
> "According to the [account name], ..."

> "Under this account, ..."

> "The [theory name] proposes that..."

> "On the X view, ..."

#### Presenting Theory B
> "In contrast, the [alternative account] suggests..."

> "Alternatively, ..."

> "A competing account holds that..."

> "However, proponents of [theory] argue that..."

#### Arbitrating Between Theories
> "The present study cannot at the moment further arbitrate between the two accounts."

> "These findings align more closely with the predictions of [theory]."

> "The results are difficult to reconcile with [theory], but consistent with [alternative]."

> "While neither account perfectly predicts our findings, the data are more compatible with..."

### Framing Your Contribution

#### Gap Identification
> "However, [specific aspect] remains poorly understood."

> "What is less clear is whether..."

> "An important question that has not been addressed is..."

> "Despite extensive research on X, little is known about Y."

> "Although this has been studied in [context], it is unknown whether the same pattern holds in [new context]."

#### Positioning Your Work
> "The present study addresses this gap by..."

> "We extend previous work by..."

> "Here we test a novel prediction of [theory]..."

> "We provide the first evidence that..."

> "Our approach differs from previous work in that..."

### Handling Unexpected Results

> "The results were unexpected given previous findings."

> "This pattern of results is at odds with [theory], which predicts..."

> "One possible explanation for this discrepancy is..."

> "We offer several possible explanations for why our results differ from..."

> "Future research should investigate why..."

### Acknowledging Limitations of Theories

> "While [theory] provides a good account of X, it remains unclear how it would explain Y."

> "This theoretical explanation is especially useful for X, but applying the same logic to Y is less straightforward."

> "The model cannot at present account for..."

> "It remains an open question whether [model] can be reconciled with..."

## Introduction Patterns

### Opening Hooks

JML introductions typically open with ONE of these approaches:

#### 1. Broad Phenomenon Statement
> "Language comprehension is not merely a bottom-up passive process of waiting for words, but also involves actively generating top-down predictions about what is likely to occur."

> "Every day, we are surrounded by visual stimuli alongside linguistically encoded information in spoken or written form."

> "Speakers sometimes make speech errors such as: *The readiness of our conventional forces are at an all-time low.*"

#### 2. Paradox or Tension
> "The compartmentalization of scientific knowledge is so often lamented that it could be concluded that this seemingly undesirable property is an inevitable concomitant of how focused scientific discovery operates."

#### 3. Practical Significance
> "Agreement errors in production arise when the attractor mismatches the subject in number."

### Structure of Introduction

**Layer 1: Broad Context** (1-2 paragraphs)
- Establish the general phenomenon
- Why it matters for cognition/language

**Layer 2: Specific Background** (3-8 paragraphs, often with subheadings)
- Review relevant literature
- Present theoretical accounts
- Identify competing predictions

**Layer 3: Gap Identification** (1 paragraph)
- Clear statement of what is unknown
- Why existing work is insufficient

**Layer 4: The Current Study** (1-3 paragraphs)
- Research questions
- Predictions
- Brief method overview

### Subheadings in Introduction

JML papers frequently use subheadings within the Introduction:

- "Models of visually situated sentence comprehension"
- "Prediction within the target language"
- "Gender agreement attraction"
- "Cue-based retrieval models"
- "The current study"

---

## The Current Study Section

### Purpose

This section explicitly states what the paper does. It appears at the END of the Introduction.

### Key Components

1. **Research questions** framed as questions or hypotheses
2. **Predictions** tied to theoretical accounts
3. **Brief method overview** (design, DV, population)

### Example Structures

#### Question-Answer Format
> "We therefore asked whether bilinguals predict word forms in just the target language that is currently in use (selective prediction) or whether they predict in both the target and the non-target languages (non-selective prediction)."

#### Hypothesis Format
> "We hypothesized that if visual working memory tasks with real-world objects strongly rely on passive long-term storage that is governed by prior knowledge, it may reduce or replace some of the abstract working memory processes used for simple features."

#### On-the-other-hand Format
> "On the one hand, it could be that visual working memory tasks that use meaningful and abstract stimuli share processes that relate to measures of fluid intelligence, in which case a correlation should be present regardless of stimulus type. On the other hand, given that visual working memory capacity for real-world objects is tied to conceptual knowledge and semantic meaning, it is plausible that no clear relation emerges."

### Typical Phrases

- "The present study set out to test..."
- "In the current study, we set out to test for the presence of..."
- "Our second goal was to evaluate the predictions of..."
- "The purpose of the current study was therefore to..."
- "We here examined how..."
- "Based on the recent evidence showing..., we here ask:"

---

## Methods Section

### Standard Subsections

1. **Participants** - N, demographics, exclusion criteria, ethics
2. **Materials/Stimuli** - Detailed description with examples
3. **Design** - Factors, levels, counterbalancing
4. **Procedure** - Trial-level description
5. **Data Analysis** - Software, models, exclusion criteria

### Participant Descriptions

> "Forty-eight participants (mean age = 23.4 years, SD = 3.2, 32 female) were recruited from the university participant pool. All were native speakers of Czech with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of [Institution]."

### Statistical Analysis Statements

> "Data were analyzed using Bayesian linear mixed-effects models implemented in the brms package (Bürkner, 2017) in R (R Core Team, 2023). Models included maximal random effects structures justified by the design (Barr et al., 2013)."

> "We report 95% credible intervals; effects were considered reliable when the 95% CI excluded zero."

---

## Results Section

### Structure

1. **Data preparation** - Exclusions, trimming
2. **Descriptive statistics** - Means, SDs, often in tables
3. **Main analyses** - Organized by hypothesis/research question
4. **Exploratory analyses** - Labeled as such

### Reporting Style

#### Frequentist
> "The main effect of grammaticality was significant, F(1, 47) = 23.4, p < .001, η²p = .33."

#### Bayesian
> "The effect of attraction was credibly different from zero (β = 0.08, 95% CI [0.02, 0.14])."

> "The evidence ratio in favor of the alternative hypothesis was BF10 = 12.3."

### Transitioning Between Analyses

- "Turning to the critical comparison..."
- "We next examined..."
- "A planned comparison revealed..."
- "Follow-up analyses showed..."

---

## Discussion Patterns

### Opening Structure

The discussion opens by restating goals and summarizing findings:

> "In the current study, we set out to test for the presence of gender agreement attraction effects in the comprehension of two closely related and mutually intelligible West Slavic languages, Czech and Slovak, and to assess the role of case syncretism in the emergence of attraction effects. Our second goal was to evaluate the predictions of the cue-based retrieval model against the observed effects."

### Summary Pattern (Multi-Experiment)

For papers with multiple experiments, summarize findings across experiments:

> "In Experiments 1 (Czech) and 2 (Slovak), only the slowdowns due to ungrammaticality were found. In the joint analysis of the data from both experiments, a small gender attraction effect was detected in the ungrammatical conditions in the verb+2 region, yet only with case-syncretic attractors. In the follow-up Experiment 3 (Czech), a gender attraction effect was detected in the verb+1 region, again only in the conditions with case-syncretic attractors."

### Theoretical Implications

Connect findings back to theoretical accounts:

> "Overall, while the attraction effects in ungrammatical sentences somewhat align with the predictions of the cue-based retrieval model, the effects observed in grammatical sentences do not."

> "The present results are broadly compatible with two existing accounts of agreement attraction, the retrieval-at-reanalysis and the feature misencoding plus task demands accounts."

### Alternative Interpretations

> "One potential explanation for the model's failure to capture the processing of grammatical sentences is that cue-based retrieval is only deployed as a part of the repair process after sentence ungrammaticality detection."

> "Alternatively, the gender mismatch configuration could create confusion about where the gender feature belongs."

### Limitations Section

**Always include.** Typical structure:

> "There are a few limitations of the current study that should be noted. First, [limitation 1]. Second, [limitation 2]."

> "One potential limitation of our study is that it does not explore the Czech and Slovak gender system in full—both languages distinguish not only between the masculine and feminine gender, but also the neuter."

> "One general caveat to consider in the current data is the potentially selective range of participants."

### Future Directions

> "Future research ought to examine different combinations of genders and animacy to determine whether gender agreement attraction in Czech is dependent on specific permutations of gender in the subject and the attractor."

> "Future investigations could incorporate crystallized intelligence tests that assess visual object recognition."

### Summary/Conclusion

Brief final paragraph that restates the main contribution:

> "Our findings reveal a reliable correlation between individual differences in fluid intelligence and visual working memory performance for both abstract simple features and real-world objects."

> "Overall, we found evidence for gender agreement attraction, specific to the ungrammatical conditions with case-syncretic attractors."

## Citation Patterns

### In-Text Citation Styles

#### Parenthetical (Most Common)
> "Agreement errors in production arise when the attractor mismatches the subject in number (Bock, Eberhard, Cutting, Meyer, & Schriefers, 2001; Bock & Miller, 1991)."

#### Narrative
> "Wagers et al. (2009) found faster reading times in the verbal and/or post-verbal region."

> "As shown by Slioussar (2018), attraction from syncretic word forms..."

### Citation Clusters

When citing multiple sources, organize chronologically or by relevance:

> "...as demonstrated in various languages, such as Dutch (Meyer & Bock, 1999), Spanish (Antón-Méndez, Nicol, & Garrett, 2002), or Serbian (Milićević & Milićev, 2022)."

### See-also Citations

> "...consistent with previous findings (see, e.g., Connor et al., 2004; Verhaegen & Poncelet, 2013)"

> "...for a recent review, see Chung, Brady & Störmer, 2024"

---

## Sentence-Level Style

### Sentence Types

JML uses a mix of:

1. **Simple declarative** for clear claims
   > "Gender attraction in comprehension has also been documented."

2. **Complex conditional** for theoretical predictions
   > "If a sentence is ungrammatical, and the subject does not fully match the retrieval cues set by the verb, the retrieval of the subject is also slowed down."

3. **Contrastive** for distinguishing positions
   > "While the aim of these studies was principally theoretical, there are also important practical reasons for extending the existing literature."

### Active vs. Passive Voice

**Active for author actions:**
> "We conducted three self-paced reading experiments."
> "We hypothesized that..."
> "We here examined how..."

**Passive for methods/findings:**
> "Data were analyzed using..."
> "Participants were recruited from..."
> "The effect was found to be significant."

### Hedging Language

JML values precise claims. Use hedges appropriately:

- "It is possible that..."
- "This suggests that..."
- "One potential explanation..."
- "It remains unclear whether..."
- "Speculatively, ..."
- "...are broadly compatible with..."
- "...somewhat align with..."

### Technical Precision

Be precise about:
- Effect directions: "faster/slower" not "different"
- Statistical claims: "reliably different from zero" vs. "significant"
- Theoretical claims: "consistent with" vs. "supports"

## Appendix: Example Extracts from JML Papers

### Example Introduction Opening (Lacina et al., 2025)

> "Speakers sometimes make speech errors such as:
>
> (1) *The readiness of our conventional forces are at an all-time low.* (Bock & Miller, 1991)
>
> In (1), the verb *be* takes the plural present indicative form *are* even though the subject head *readiness*, with which it ought to agree, is singular. The verb appears to erroneously agree with the linearly closer noun *forces*, known as the attractor. Agreement errors in production arise when the attractor mismatches the subject in number (Bock, Eberhard, Cutting, Meyer, & Schriefers, 2001; Bock & Miller, 1991). This has become known as the phenomenon of agreement attraction..."

### Example "Current Study" Section (Chung et al., 2025)

> "Based on the recent evidence showing that meaningful stimuli, such as real-world objects, are better maintained in visual working memory than simple and meaningless shapes, we here ask: Does the previously observed relationship between visual working memory capacity and fluid intelligence extend to working memory tasks that use more complex and meaningful real-world objects? On the one hand, it could be that visual working memory tasks that use meaningful and abstract stimuli share processes that relate to measures of fluid intelligence, in which case a correlation should be present regardless of stimulus type. On the other hand, given that visual working memory capacity for real-world objects is tied to conceptual knowledge and semantic meaning, it is plausible that no clear relation emerges..."

### Example Discussion Opening (Lacina et al., 2025)

> "In the current study, we set out to test for the presence of gender agreement attraction effects in the comprehension of two closely related and mutually intelligible West Slavic languages, Czech and Slovak, and to assess the role of case syncretism in the emergence of attraction effects. Our second goal was to evaluate the predictions of the cue-based retrieval model against the observed effects. We conducted three self-paced reading experiments, comparing potential attraction effects from case-syncretic and non-syncretic attractors. In Experiments 1 (Czech) and 2 (Slovak), only the slowdowns due to ungrammaticality were found..."

### Example Limitations Section (Lacina et al., 2025)

> "One potential limitation of our study is that it does not explore the Czech and Slovak gender system in full—both languages distinguish not only between the masculine and feminine gender, but also the neuter. In addition, masculine nouns have different forms and agreement patterns depending on their animacy. Future research ought to examine different combinations of genders and animacy to determine whether gender agreement attraction in Czech is dependent on specific permutations of gender in the subject and the attractor."

## Additional Sections

### Abstract Structure

JML abstracts typically follow this structure (150-250 words):

1. **Context/Background** (1-2 sentences): What is the general phenomenon?
2. **Gap/Problem** (1 sentence): What is unknown or debated?
3. **Purpose** (1 sentence): What did this study do?
4. **Method** (1-2 sentences): Key design elements
5. **Results** (2-3 sentences): Main findings
6. **Conclusion** (1-2 sentences): What this means

### Cross-Referencing Within Paper

JML papers use forward and backward references to create cohesion:

#### Forward References (Signposting)
> "We will return to this proposal in the General discussion (Section 'General discussion')."

> "We return to this issue in the Discussion."

> "We briefly return to this in Experiment 3."

> "We will return to this point again in the discussion below."

#### Backward References
> "As noted above, ..."

> "Recall that ..."

> "As we mentioned in the Introduction, ..."

> "Consistent with our earlier finding that ..."

### Reporting Null Results

JML handles null findings carefully and transparently:

#### Standard Null Reporting
> "The interaction was not significant, F(2.91, 168.6) = 2.289, p = .08."

> "We found no evidence of a correlation between X and Y."

> "The pairwise comparison was not significant (t = 0.34, p = .73)."

> "This difference was not significant, t(45.343) = 1.2, p = .24."

#### Bayesian Null Reporting
> "The evidence ratio in favor of the null hypothesis was BF01 = 4.2."

> "CFMT scores were not significantly correlated with performance (r = -.06, p = .44, BF10 < 1)."

#### Framing Unexpected Nulls
> "It is somewhat surprising that we failed to observe cross-grain size priming within the linguistic domain."

> "The null effect was unexpected given previous findings."

> "We are reluctant to interpret this null effect as a strong argument against..."

### Replication and Extension Framing

#### Replication Language
> "Experiment 1 replicated previous findings that..."

> "The results observed in the LTM task replicated the findings of a previous study."

> "We replicated our results concerning feature informativeness using..."

> "This result extends previous work by..."

> "Building on the work of [Author], we..."

#### Failed Replication Language
> "...revealed that we failed to replicate the math priming effect."

> "It is possible to distinguish between a true null effect and inconclusive evidence, and Bayes Factor comparisons..."

### Multi-Experiment Paper Structure

#### Experiment Introduction Patterns
> "Experiment 1 tested whether attachment in relative clause sentences..."

> "Experiment 2 further examined whether the presentation order influenced..."

> "To address this design limitation, we conducted a second experiment in which..."

> "In the following experiments, we focused on..."

#### Interim Summary Sections

Multi-experiment papers include brief summaries between experiments:

**Section heading:** "Summary of Experiment 1" or "Discussion"

**Structure:**
1. Restate what was tested
2. Key findings in 2-3 sentences
3. What remains to be tested
4. Introduction to next experiment

**Example:**
> "Experiment 1 replicated previous findings that recall errors for both PMIs and UMIs are influenced by self-state load. More importantly, we found that the recall errors for both the PMIs and UMIs deteriorated when the another-state load increased, indicating considerable interactions between items with varying priorities in VWM. Additionally, we found that these interactive effects were asymmetric, with UMI recall being more affected by PMI than the opposite. In the following experiments, we focused on the interaction patterns between PMIs and UMIs during VWM."

#### General Discussion in Multi-Experiment Papers

Opens with summary across all experiments:

> "Experiment 1 examined whether... We found...
> Experiment 2 examined whether... We found...
> Experiment 3 compared whether... We found..."

Then proceeds to theoretical implications, alternative interpretations, limitations, and future directions.
