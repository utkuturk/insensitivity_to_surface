**Context**: I am writing a psycholinguistics paper on "Attenuated Attraction in Scene Description." I have three source documents that need to be synthesized into a high-quality Introduction chapter.

**Source Documents**:
1.  **`outline.txt` (The Structural Truth)**: This is the approved outline. You MUST follow this structure and logic flow rigidly. If a point is here, it goes in the paper. If it's not, be careful.
2.  **`text.txt` (The Content Draft)**: This is the current draft. It contains the core content but reads too much like a "list of points" and lacks flow. Use this for specific citations and data points.
3.  **`long_speculative.txt` (The Context/Flavor)**: This version has better prose and "good contextualization" but contains speculative claims that might be ungrounded. Use this to improve the *flow* and *transitions* of the draft, but **do not** adopt its unverified claims if they contradict the outline.

**Your Goal**:
Rewrite the **Introduction** section (covering the Phenomenon, Selectivity, Scene Description Puzzle, Response Set, and Contribution).

**Stylistic Constraints (from Coauthor Persona)**:
*   **No Mystery Novels**: State the puzzle and the proposed solution early.
*   **Signposting**: Explicitly bridge the gap between "Agreement Attraction" and "Response Set". Why are we talking about picture naming in an agreement paper? (Answer: Because of the *viability* of competitors).
*   **Deflationary**: When discussing the "variability" in previous studies, frame it as a methodological puzzle that *we* are solving, not just "noise".

**Action**:
Please rewrite the introduction by synthesizing these sources. 
-   Start with the **broad definition** of attraction (from `long_speculative`).
-   Move quickly to the **puzzle** of variability (from `text.txt` and `outline`).
-   Introduce the **Response Set** logic as the key theoretical innovation (bridging `text.txt` and `long_speculative`).
-   End with the **Overview of Experiments** as laid out in `outline.txt`.

**Output Format**:
Provide the rewritten text in Markdown. Use bolding for key terms but keep the tone formal and academic (Geneva/Maryland style).
