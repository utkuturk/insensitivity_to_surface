\section*{Highlights}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Tested whether phonological modulation penetrates memory retrieval for agreement.
    \item Verbal attractors with surface overlap did not induce agreement attraction.
    \item Genitive plural nouns induced robust attraction, unlike verbal homophones.
    \item Phonological overlap alone does not modulate dependency resolution.
    \item Memory access is gated by abstract controller potential, not surface form.
\end{itemize}
